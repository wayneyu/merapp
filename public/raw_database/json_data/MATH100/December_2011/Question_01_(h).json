        "In order to find the slope of the tangent line, we need to take the\nderivative. However, because this expression is not written in the form\n\\emph{y = f(x)}, we will have to use implicit differentiation with\nrespect to \\emph{x}.\n\nThus we implicitly differentiate the expression with respect to\n\\emph{x}. Note that the term \\emph{x\\textsuperscript{2}} can be\ndifferentiated directly, the term \\emph{xy} requires the product rule,\nand the term \\emph{y\\textsuperscript{2}} requires the chain rule.\n\n\\[2x + y + x\\frac{dy}{dx} + 2y\\frac{dy}{dx} = 0\\] Since we are finding a\nspecific derivative at the point \\emph{(0,2)}, we can go ahead and plug\nin the values \\emph{x=0} and \\emph{y=2} to get:\n\n\\[2(0) + (2) + (0)\\frac{dy}{dx} + 2(2)\\frac{dy}{dx} = 0\\]\n\n\\[2 + 4\\frac{dy}{dx} = 0\\] If we solve the above expression for the\nderivative \\emph{dy/dx} we get:\n\n\\[\\frac{dy}{dx} = \\frac{-2}{4} = \\frac{-1}{2}\\] So the slope of the\ntangent line is -1/2."
