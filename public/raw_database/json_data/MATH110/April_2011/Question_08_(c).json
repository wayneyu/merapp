        "At a function's x-intercept, its y-value is equal to zero. Thus to find\nour x-intercepts, we need to set the function equal to 0 and solve for\n$x$.\n\n\\[0 = \\ln(4 - x^2)\\]\n\nWe raise both sides by \\emph{e} to cancel the logarithm and get:\n\n\\begin{align*}\ne^0 &= e^{\\ln(4 - x^2)} \\\\\n1 &= 4 - x^2 \\\\\nx^2 &= 3 \\\\\n\\pm\\sqrt{3} &= x \\end{align*}\n\nSo our two x-intercepts are at $x = \\pm\\sqrt{3}$.\n\nThe y-intercept of a function occurs when $x = 0$. Therefore the\ny-intercept is $\\displaystyle {}y=\\ln{4}$."
