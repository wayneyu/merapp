        "To compute the determinant, we must perform Gaussian elimination on this\nmatrix until it is in upper triangular form, at which point the\ndeterminant of the matrix will be the product of the main diagonal.\n\nTo get this matrix into upper triangular form, take row 2 and subtract\nit from row 1, then take row 3 and subtract it from row 1, and finally\ntake row 4 and subtract it from row 1. This produces the matrix:\n\n$\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 1 & 1 & 1\\\\ \n0 & 1 & 2 & 3\\\\ \n0 & 0 & 3 & 2\\\\ \n0 & 0 & 0 & 2\n\\end{bmatrix}$Note this matrix is in upper triangular form since there are all\n0$^{\\prime}$s below the main diagonal.The determinant is the product of the diagonal, which is just\n$1 * 1 * 3 * 2 = 6$Therefore, the determinant of the matrix $\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 1 & 1 & 1\\\\ \n1 & 2 & 3 & 4\\\\ \n1 & 1 & 4 & 3\\\\ \n1 & 1 & 1 & 3\n\\end{bmatrix}$ is 6."
