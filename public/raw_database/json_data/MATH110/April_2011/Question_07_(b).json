        "Our line has a \\emph{y}-intercept when $x = 0$. Plugging this into our\nequation of the line, we get\n\n\\begin{align*}y = m(0) - m + 1 = -m + 1.\\end{align*}\n\nSo our \\emph{y}-intercept is $(0, -m + 1)$.\n\nSimilarly, our \\emph{x}-intercept occurs when $y = 0$. Setting our\nequation equal to zero and solving for $x$, we get\n\n\\begin{align*}0 = mx - m + 1\\end{align*}\n\nWe see that if \\emph{m=0}, then there is no \\emph{x}-intercept (the line\nis horizontal). Otherwise\n\n\\begin{align*}x = \\frac{m-1}{m}\\end{align*}\n\nand our \\emph{x}-intercept is $\\left(\\frac{m-1}{m} ,0\\right)$."
