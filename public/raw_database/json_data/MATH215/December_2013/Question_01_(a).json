        "With $y'' + 2y' + y = 0$, we first solve the characteristic equation\n$r^2 + 2r + 1 = (r+1)^2 = 0$ so $r=-1.$\n\nAs the root is repeated, we only get one solution of the form $e^{-t}$.\nThe other solution will be $t e^{-t}$.\n\nThe general solution is a linear combination of these two independent\nsolutions, $y = A e^{-t} + B t e^{-t}$."
