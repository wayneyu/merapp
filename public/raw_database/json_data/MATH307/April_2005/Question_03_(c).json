        "Geometrically we can see that the eigenvalues of a reflection matrix\nare$-1$ (in the case that they reflect over something other than itself)\nor $1$ if it reflects over itself.\n\nThe corresponding eigenspace associating to $\\lambda_1 = -1$ is the line\nnormal, and the eigenspace associating to $\\lambda_2 = 1$ is the line of\nreflection."
