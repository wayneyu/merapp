        "To determine where $f$ is increasing or decreasing, we look at the sign\nof the first derivative. The first derivative, calculated using the\nchain rule, is:\n\n\\[f'(x) = \\frac{-2x}{4-x^2} = \\frac{2x}{x^2-4}\\]\n\nIt has critical points at $x = 0, -2, 2$. The values \\emph{-2} and\n\\emph{2} are not part of the domain, but \\emph{x = 0} is. We first note\nthat the denominator is always negative on the domain\n$\\displaystyle (-2,2)$. Hence, the sign of the derivative is always the\nopposite sign of the numerator. For \\emph{x \\textless{} 0} we see that\n$\\displaystyle f'(x) > 0$, while for \\emph{x \\textgreater{} 0} we see\nthat $\\displaystyle f'(x) < 0$.\n\nHence, \\emph{$f$} is increasing on \\emph{(-2,0)} and decreasing on\n\\emph{(0,2)}.\n\n''Note. This also means that \\emph{$f$} has a local maximum at \\emph{x =\n0}."
