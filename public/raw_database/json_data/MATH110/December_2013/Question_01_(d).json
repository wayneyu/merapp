        "\\textbf{False:} If $f(x)$ is differentiable at $x=2$, then by the\ndefinition of derivative at a point, we have\n$\\displaystyle f'(2) = \\lim_{h\\rightarrow0}\\frac{f(2+h)-f(2)}{h}.$ So to\nparaphrase the statement, we are asking whether\n$\\displaystyle f'(2) = 2$. Clearly, this does not have to be the case.\nConsider the example $\\displaystyle f(x)=1$. We have\n$\\displaystyle f(x)$ is differentiable at $x=2$ (and everywhere else\ntoo). But $f'(2) = 0$."
