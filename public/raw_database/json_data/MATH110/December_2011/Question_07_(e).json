Using this fact, or\nby calculating where the derivative of $f$ is zero, we can deduce that\nthe minimum of $f(x)$ is at \\emph{x = 3}. To find the y-value at this\npoint we simply plug in \\emph{x = 3} to get $y = (3)^2 - 6(3) = -9$.\nPlotting the roots and the minimum on the graph should allow you to\nsketch the curve.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htbp]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=.5\\textwidth]{MathExamResourcesCoursesMATH110December_2011Question_07_(e)Solution_1a.jpg}\n\\caption{MathExamResourcesCoursesMATH110December 2011Question 07 (e)Solution 1a.jpg}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\itemsep1pt\\parskip0pt\\parsep0pt\n\\item\n  $P = (4, -12)$\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\begin{figure}[htbp]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=.5\\textwidth]{MathExamResourcesCoursesMATH110December_2011Question_07_(e)Solution_1b.jpg}\n\\caption{MathExamResourcesCoursesMATH110December 2011Question 07 (e)Solution 1b.jpg}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\itemsep1pt\\parskip0pt\\parsep0pt\n\\item\n  Tangent lines that pass through P\n\\end{itemize}\n\nWe know there are two lines. Both pass through the point $(4, -12)$ and\ntheir two slopes are -2 and 6 (from part c). The equation of the two\nlines are thus\n\n$y + 12 = -2(x - 4)$\n\n$y + 12 = 6(x -4)$\n\nOr in \\emph{y = mx + b} form\n\n$y + 12 = -2x - 4$\n\n$y = 6x -36$\n\nAlternatively, you know that the line with slope -2 passes through P and\nthe point \\emph{(2, f(2)) = (2, -8)}, while the line with slope 6 passes\nthrough P and the point \\emph{(6, f(6)) = (6, 0)}. Drawing these points\nand then connecting them with lines will also produce the correct\npicture.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htbp]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=.5\\textwidth]{MathExamResourcesCoursesMATH110December_2011Question_07_(e)Solution_1c.jpg}\n\\caption{MathExamResourcesCoursesMATH110December 2011Question 07 (e)Solution 1c.jpg}\n\\end{figure}"
