        "As mentioned in the hint, if we can find a counter example to the\nstatement for any $n$, then the statement is false since, if true, it\nmust hold for \\textbf{ALL} $n$.\n\nConsider $2\\times{2}$ matrices with all entries zero except for the\nalternating diagonals. Specifically, we mean let\n\n\\begin{align*}\nA=\\begin{bmatrix}\na  &  0\\\\\n0  &  0\n\\end{bmatrix},\\qquad\nB=\\begin{bmatrix}\n0  &  0\\\\\n0  &  b\n\\end{bmatrix}.\n\\end{align*}\n\nWe choose these matrices because we know that the determinant of a\ndiagonal matrix is just the product of its diagonal elements. Of course,\nsince these are $2\\times{2}$ matrices we could easily compute any\ndeterminant, but these matrices also satisfy a condition of the\nstatement which is that det(A)=det(B)=0. We can then compute det(A+B),\n\n\\[\\textrm{det}(A+B)=\n\\begin{vmatrix}\na  &  0\\\\\n0  &  b\n\\end{vmatrix}=ab\\]\n\nwhich is \\textbf{not} zero for arbitrary a and b with $a\\neq{0}$,\n$b\\neq{0}$. Therefore we have found a whole class of $2\\times{2}$\nmatrices that satisfy det(A)=det(B)=0 but which do not satisfy\ndet(A+B)=0. Since the statement claims to be true for \\textbf{ALL}\n$n\\times{n}$ matrices we can use our counter example to verify the\nstatement is \\textbf{false}.\n\n\\emph{Note that only one counterexample would be enough, so your\nsolution is just as good, if you choose numbers for $a$ and $b$, e.g.\n$a=b=1.$}"

        "Recall it is much easier to prove something is false, since all you\nrequire is one counter example. Can you think of an example such that\nthis is not true? You can choose any value for $n,$ whichever makes\nfinding a counter example the easiest for you."
