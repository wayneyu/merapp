        "The answer is iv.\n\nAt the point of \\emph{x=0}, \\emph{G(0)=0} because the top and bottom\nlimits of the integral that defines \\emph{G(x)} are identical. The area\nthat is integrated over has zero width.\n\nAt the point of \\emph{x=2}, \\emph{G(2)=2} because the area of the graph\ncan be calculated using the area of triangle formula \\emph{height*base/2\n= 2*2/2 =2}\n\nAt the point of \\emph{x=4}, \\emph{G(4)=-2} because the area between the\n\\emph{x}-axis and the graph \\emph{g(x)} is composed of two triangles\nwith height \\emph{4} and width \\emph{1}. Hence the area is given by\n\\emph{4*1/2 + 4*1/2 = 4}. It is below the \\emph{x}-axis, hence we\nsubtract it from the previous value and get \\emph{G(4) = 2 - 4 = -2}.\n\nAt the point \\emph{x=6}, \\emph{G(6)=0} because we add the area of the\ntriangle with height \\emph{2} and width \\emph{2} to the previous value:\n\\emph{G(6) = -2 + 2*2/2 = 0}\n\nAt the point \\emph{x=8}, \\emph{G(8)=4} because we add the area of the\nsquare with height \\emph{2} and width \\emph{2} to the previous value:\n\\emph{G(8) = 0 + 2*2 = 4}"
