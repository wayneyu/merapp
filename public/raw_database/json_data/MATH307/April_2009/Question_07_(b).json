        "Since every convergent sequence is Cauchy and every Cauchy sequence in\n$\\mathbb{R}$ converges, we can write the sequence as a Cauchy sequence\nto find the values of a and b for which the sequence converges to a\nfinite limit. So for every $\\epsilon > 0$ there is a natural number N\nsuch that for every n and m integers greater than or equal to N,\n$|x_n - x_m| < \\epsilon$. Then\n$|(2^n - 1)b - (2^n - 2)a - (2^m - 1)b + (2^m - 2)a| < \\epsilon$, and so\n$|b(2^n - 2^m) - (2^n - 2^m)a| < \\epsilon$, that is,\n$|(b-a)(2^n - 2^m)| < \\epsilon$. Since $|2^n - 2^m|$ can be arbitrarily\nlarge and we want this to be true for all $\\epsilon > 0$, we propose\nthat we need $b = a$.\n\nSuppose $b = a$. Then $|x_n - x_m| = |0(2^n - 2^m)| = 0 < \\epsilon$, as\nrequired.\n\nNow suppose there is some value of a such that $a \\not= b$ but\n$|(b-a)(2^n - 2^m)| < \\epsilon$. Then let $k = |b - a|$ and take\n$\\epsilon = k$. Then $|k(2^n - 2^m)| = |k(2^{n-m}(2^m - 1))|$. Since we\ncan take n and m to be any integers such that they are greater than or\nequal to N, take $m = N$ and $n = N + 1$. Then\n$|k(2(2^N - 1))| \\ge |2k| > k$ since $N \\ge 1$. This contradicts our\nassumption that there is a $k \\not= 0$ such that for any $\\epsilon > 0$,\n$|x_n - x_m| < \\epsilon$.\n\nSo the sequence converges to a finite limit when \\emph{b = a}."
