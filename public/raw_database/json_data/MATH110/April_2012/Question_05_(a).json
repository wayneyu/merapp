        "The numerator and denominator are polynomials, which are defined\neverywhere. However, since $f(x)$ is a fraction, we need to avoid points\nwhere the denominator is zero, i.e. where $x^2 - 1 = 0$. This occurs\nwhen $x = 1$ and $x = -1$. So the domain of $f(x)$ is\n\n$(-\\infty, -1) \\cup (-1, 1) \\cup (1, \\infty)$"
