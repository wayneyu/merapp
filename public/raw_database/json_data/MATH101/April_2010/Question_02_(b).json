        "We can consider one loop of the polar curve to be defined by the values\nof $\\theta$ in between successive points where $r = 0$. Consider that\n$\\cos(z) = 0$, where $z = -\\pi/2$ and $\\pi/2$, so we can take $\\theta$\nto be vary in between $\\theta = -\\pi/4$ and $\\pi / 4$ to define a loop.\n\nNow consider that the area of a wedge with angle $\\Delta \\theta$ is\nequal to $r^{2}\\Delta \\theta/2$ where $r$ is the'radius' of the wedge\n(i.e: from the point to the rounded boundary). To compute the total area\nof the loop we simply integrate in between the appropriate angles.\n\n\\begin{align*}\nA &= \\int_{-\\pi/4}^{\\pi/4}\\frac{1}{2}r(\\theta)^{2}\\,d\\theta \\\\\n&= 8\\int_{-\\pi/4}^{\\pi/4}\\cos^{2}(2\\theta)\\,d\\theta\n\\end{align*}\n\nUsing a trigonometric identity, we can simplify this integral so we are\nnot dealing with the square of a trig function.\n\n\\begin{align*}\nA &= 8\\int_{-\\pi/4}^{\\pi/4}\\cos^{2}(2\\theta)\\,d\\theta \\\\\n& = 4\\int_{-\\pi/4}^{\\pi/4}1 + \\cos(4\\theta)\\,d\\theta \\\\\n& = 2\\pi\n\\end{align*}\n\nTherefore, the area of one loop of the polar curve $r = 4\\cos(2\\theta)$\nis $2\\pi$."
