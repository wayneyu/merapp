        "We will evaluate this integral using integration by parts. The\nintegration by parts formula says that the following holds:\n\n\\[\\int u\\,dv = uv - \\int v\\,du.\\] If we let\n\n\\[u = \\ln(x), \\quad dv = \\frac{1}{x^{7}}\\,dx\\] then we have\n\n\\[du = \\frac{1}{x}\\,dx, \\quad v = -\\frac{1}{6}x^{-6}\\] and we can use\nthe integration by parts formula to write\n\n\\begin{align*}\n\\int \\frac{\\ln(x)}{x^{7}}\\,dx &= \\ln(x)\\cdot \\left(-\\frac{1}{6}x^{-6}\\right) - \\int \\left(-\\frac{1}{6}x^{-6}\\right)\\frac{1}{x}\\,dx\\\\\n&= -\\frac{\\ln(x)}{6x^{6}} + \\int \\frac{1}{6x^{7}}\\,dx \\\\\n&= -\\frac{\\ln(x)}{6x^{6}} - \\frac{1}{36x^{6}} + C\n\\end{align*} where $C$ is a constant of integration.\n\n Therefore,$\\quad{\\color{blue}\n\\int \\frac{\\ln(x)}{x^{7}}\\,dx = -\\frac{\\ln(x)}{6x^{6}} - \\frac{1}{36x^{6}} + C\n}$"
