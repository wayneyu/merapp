Assume that\n\n\\[f(x) = \\begin{cases}\np_1(x) & \\text{for } x_1 \\leq x \\leq x_2 \\\\\np_2(x) & \\text{for } x_2 \\leq x \\leq x_3 \\\\\np_3(x) & \\text{for } x_3 \\leq x \\leq x_4\n\\end{cases}\\]\n\nwhere each \\emph{p}\\textsubscript{i}(\\emph{x}) is a polynomial.\n\n\\textbf{(b)} What equations, written in terms of\n\\emph{p}\\textsubscript{i}(\\emph{x}) and possibly their derivatives,\nexpress the condition that $\\displaystyle f'(x)$ is continuous?",

    "sols": [
        "The function $\\displaystyle f'(x)$ being continuous implies that the\nslopes of the adjacent polynomials must be the same at $x_i$, for\n\\emph{i = 2, 3}. In our case this implies\n\n\\begin{align*}\np'_1(x_2) = p'_2(x_2) \\\\\np'_2(x_3) = p'_3(x_3)\n\\end{align*}"
    ], 
    "hints": [
        "The function \\emph{$f$'(x)} is continuous if the slope to the left of the\npoints \\emph{x\\textsubscript{i}} approaches the slope to the right of\nthe points. This only applies to the inner points of the interval, not\nthe endpoints."
