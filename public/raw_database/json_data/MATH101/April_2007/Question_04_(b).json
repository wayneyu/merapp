        "\\textbf{Particular Solution}\n\nWe proceed as in the hints. First, we find a solution to\n\n$\\displaystyle y'' - 4y' + 5y = 5x^{2} - 3x -2$\n\nby noticing that since the right hand side is a quadratic polynomial and\nthe left hand side is a second order differential equation, we have that\na solution is given by\n\n$\\displaystyle y = Ax^{2} + Bx + C$\n\nand we solve for \\emph{A},\\emph{B} and \\emph{C}. Direct substitution\nyields\n\n\\begin{align*}\n5x^{2} - 3x -2 &= y'' - 4y' + 5y  \\\\\n&= 2A -4(2Ax + B) + 5(Ax^{2} + Bx + C)\\\\\n&= 2A -8Ax -4B + 5Ax^{2} + 5Bx + 5C\\\\\n&= 5Ax^{2} + (5B-8A)x + 5C - 4B + 2A\\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\nIsolating to one side yields\n\n$\\displaystyle (5-5A)x^{2} +(8A-5B-3)x +4B-2A-5C-2 = 0$\n\nSince this must hold for all \\emph{x} values, we have that each of the\nindividual coefficients must be zero. This gives\n\n\\begin{align*}\n5-5A &= 0\\\\\n8A - 5B - 3 &= 0\\\\\n4B-2A-5C-2 &= 0\n\\end{align*}\n\nSolving gives \\emph{A}=1, \\emph{B}=1 and \\emph{C}= 0. Hence, a solution\nto our differential equation is\n\n$\\displaystyle y = x^{2} + x$\n\n\\textbf{Homogeneous solution}\n\nThe story is not over yet. We could add the particular solution to\nsolutions found via\n\n$\\displaystyle y'' - 4y' + 5y = 0$\n\nAdding these solutions together would give the full set of solutions. To\nsolve the homogeneous part notice that the corresponding polynomial\ngiven by\n\n$\\displaystyle r^{2} - 4r + 5 = 0$\n\nhas two imaginary roots given by (using the quadratic formula)\n\n$r = \\frac{-(-4) \\pm \\sqrt{(-4)^{2}-4(1)(5)}}{2} = \\frac{4 \\pm \\sqrt{-4}}{2} = 2 \\pm i$\n\nHence, to this new differential equation, we have the solutions\n\n$\\displaystyle y = C_{1}e^{2x}\\cos(x) + C_{2}e^{2x}\\sin(x)$\n\nCombining solutions, we have that\n\n$\\displaystyle y = C_{1}e^{2x}\\cos(x) + C_{2}e^{2x}\\sin(x) + x^{2} + x$.\n\n\\textbf{Initial Conditions}\n\nNow we would be done except, this is an initial value problem so we need\nto solve for the constants. The initial conditions are $y(0) = 0$ and\n$y'(0) = 2$. Hence, plugging in these values, we get that\n\n$\\displaystyle 0 = y(0) = C_{1}e^{2(0)}\\cos(0) + C_{2}e^{2(0)}\\sin(0) + (0)^{2} + (0) = C_{1}$\n\nand that (taking the derivative via the product rule)\n\n\\begin{align*}\ny' &= C_{1}(2e^{2x}\\cos(x) -\\sin(x)e^{2x}) + C_{2}(2e^{2x}\\sin(x)  + \\cos(x)e^{2x}) + 2x + 1\\\\\n2 = y'(0) &= C_{1}(2e^{2(0)}\\cos(0) -\\sin(0)e^{2(0)}) + C_{2}(2e^{2(0)}\\sin(0)  + \\cos(0)e^{2(0)}) + 2(0) + 1 \\\\\n2 = y'(0) &= 0(2 -0) + C_{2}(0  + 1) + 2(0) + 1 \\\\\n1 &=C_{2} \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\nNOTE: Above plugging in 0 for $C_{1}$ immediately would make the above\ncomputation simpler. Hence, the final solution is\n\n$\\displaystyle y = e^{2x}\\sin(x) + x^{2} + x$.\n\nPhew!"
