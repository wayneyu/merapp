    "statement": "You invest \\$100 000 now at an annual interest rate of 7\\%, compounded\ncontinuously. Your plan is to retire once the rate of growth of your\ninvestment is \\$10 000 per year. In how many years will you retire?",

        "Recall the formula for continuously compounded interest,\n\n\\[A = Pe^{rt}\\] where $A,P,r$ are the future value, principal and growth\nrate respectively and $t$ is the time since the investment was made. The\nrate of growth of the investment is simply the time derivative of the\nfuture value (i.e. $dA/dt$). Evaluating the time derivative of $A$\ngives:\n\n\\[\\frac{d}{dt}A = \\frac{d}{dt}\\left(Pe^{rt}\\right) = rPe^{rt}.\\] By the\ninformation given in the question, we want to solve for the time $t$\nwhen the $dA/dt = 10,000$ dollars/year, given $P = 100,000$ dollars and\n$r = 0.07$ yr$^{-1}$.\n\n\\begin{align*}\n10000 &= (0.07)(100000)e^{0.07t}\\\\\n10000 &= 7000e^{\\frac{7}{100}t} \\\\\n\\frac{10}{7} &= e^{\\frac{7}{100}t}\\\\\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{10}{7}\\right) &= \\frac{7}{100}t\\\\\n\\rightarrow \\quad t &= \\frac{100}{7}\\ln\\left(\\frac{10}{7}\\right) \\quad (\\approx 5.10)\n\\end{align*} Therefore, we would need to wait (100/7)ln(10/7) years for\nour initial investment to be growing at a rate of \\$10,000 per year so\nwe can retire."
