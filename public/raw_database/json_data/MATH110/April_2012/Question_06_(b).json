    "statement": "In a fission nuclear weapon, a sphere of uranium-235 is compressed to a\nfraction of its size, forcing at least one atomic nucleus to split and\nrelease neutrons. These neutrons force other nuclei to release\n\\emph{their} neutrons, and so on. The result is that the number of\nneutrons grows exponentially.\n\nLet \\emph{P(t)} be the number of neutrons \\emph{t} seconds after\ndetonation. The number of neutrons satisfies the differential equation\n\n\\[\\displaystyle\n\\frac{dP}{dt} = 10^8P(t).\\]\n\n\\textbf{(b)} According to your model in part\n\\href{Science:Math Exam Resources/Courses/MATH110/April 2012/Question 6 (a)}{(a)},\nhow long does it take a given number of neutrons to double?",

        "We will call our given number of neutrons at the start (when t = 0),\n$P_0$. Note that when we calculate the number of neutrons at the start,\nwe get $P(0) = 1$. So in order for our function $P(t)$ to give us the\nstarting number of neutrons, $P_0$, we need to multiply $e^{10^8t}$ by\n$P_0$ to get our final formula, $P(t) = P_0e^{10^8t}$.\n\nTo calculate how long it takes for the neutrons to double, we set our\nfunction $P(t)$ equal to double the starting amount, or $2P_0$. This\ngives us\n\n\\[2P_0 = P_0e^{10^8t}\\]\n\nAfter canceling the $P_0$ from both sides, taking a natural logarithm of\nboth sides, and simplifying using log rules we get\n\n\\[\\ln(2) = \\ln(e^{10^8t})\\]\n\n\\[\\displaystyle \\ln(2) = 10^8t\\]\n\n\\[\\frac{\\ln(2)}{10^8} = t\\]"
