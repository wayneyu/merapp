        "To Find a matrix P such that $P^{-1}AP$ is diagonal, we need to find the\nmatrix P formed by the eigenvectors of A. Using Matlab commands to find\nthe eigenvectors, we write {[}V,L{]}=eig(A). Then we have V =\n$\\begin{bmatrix}\n0& 0.8165 &-0.7071 \\\\ \n1& 0.4082 &0 \\\\ \n0& 0.4082 &0.7071 \n\\end{bmatrix}$\n\nSince V is formed by the eigenvectors of A, the matrix P = V."
