        "First, we need to show that the factor $x^{2} + 9$ is irreducible.\nLooking at the discriminant, we see that it is\n$b^{2}-4ac = 0-4(1)(9) = -36 < 0$ and so this factor has no real roots.\nThus, this is an irreducible quadratic. Hence, the partial fraction\ndecomposition is\n\n$\\frac{10}{(x+1)^{2}(x^{2}+9)} = \\frac{A}{x+1} + \\frac{B}{(x+1)^{2}} + \\frac{Cx + D}{x^{2} + 9}$"
