The reasoning is explained in the\nfollowing points:\n\n(1): Applying the matrix $\\displaystyle A$ to a vector once will rotate\nthe vector counterclockwise by 60 degrees. Applying the matrix\n$\\displaystyle A$ to a vector twice (i.e. $A^{2}$) will rotate the\nvector counterclockwise by 120 degrees... Applying it to a vector 6\ntimes (i.e. $A^{6}$) will rotate the vector counterclockwise by 360\ndegrees... giving us the original vector back, just as applying the\nidentity matrix $I$ would do. Hence (1) is true.\n\n(2): If $v = Au$, then \\emph{v} the 60 degree counterclockwise rotated\nversion of \\emph{u}. Also if $v = Au$, then $u = A^{-1}v$, which tells\nus that $A^{-1}$ is the matrix corresponding to 60 degree clockwise\nrotation. So $A, A^{-1}$ are not the same matrix operator and (2) is\nfalse.\n\n(3): Since the matrix $B$ will reflect a vector across the line\n$y = \\sqrt{3}x$, applying $B$ twice to a vector will reflect the vector\nacross the same line twice, resulting in the original vector. Hence\napplying the matrix $B$ three times to a vector will reflect it across\nthe line. This is not equivalent to multiplying the vector by $I$ and so\n(3) is false.\n\n(4): If $B^{-1} = B$, then $I = B^{2}$ which, as we mentioned in (3), is\ntrue since reflecting a vector across the line twice gives the original\nvector. Therefore, (4) is true.\n\n(5): Projections are non-invertible operations (since you cannot\nuniquely determine the original vector from its projection) and since\n$C$ is a projection, $C^{-1}$ does not even exist. So (5) is false.\n\n(6): Since $C$ is a projection, it satisfies (6) by definition and so\n(6) is true."

        "Consider what happens by repeatedly applying the matrices to themselves.\n\nFor example, if we apply the rotate by 60 degrees matrix twice, how much\ndoes the resulting matrix rotate in total?\n\nSimilarly, if we reflect a vector twice about a line, where does it end\nup?\n\nWhat happens if we reflect a vector to the same line twice?\n\nAre all these operations invertible?"
