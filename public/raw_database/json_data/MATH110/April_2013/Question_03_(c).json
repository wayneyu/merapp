        "Using the quotient rule, we find:\n\n\\begin{align*}f'(x) &= \\frac{(\\cos x)(e^x) - (\\sin x)(e^x)}{(e^x)^2} \\\\\n &=  \\frac{e^x(\\cos x - \\sin x)}{(e^x)^2} \\\\\n&= \\frac{\\cos x - \\sin x}{e^x}\n\\end{align*}\n\nSetting $\\displaystyle f'(x) = 0$, we can clear the denominator and get:\n\n\\[\\displaystyle \\cos x - \\sin x = 0\\]\n\nor, equivalently,\n\n\\[\\displaystyle \\cos x = \\sin x\\]\n\nThis equation has infinitely many solutions, but only one which is in\nthe interval \\emph{{[}0,$\\pi${]}}. The trig ratios $\\cos x$ and $\\sin x$ are\nequal on a 45-45-90 degree triangle, so the angle in the interval\n\\emph{{[}0,$\\pi${]}} that solves the above equation is 45 degrees, or in\nradian measure, $x = \\pi /4$.\n\nNext, we check to see if there are any critical points where $f'(x)$ is\nundefined. The derivative would be undefined where the denominator is\nequal to zero, but because $e^x$ is always positive, we don't need to\nworry about this here.\n\nThus we have one critical point at $x = \\pi /4$. Performing the first\nderivative test, we get:\n\n\\begin{longtable}[c]{@{}llll@{}}\n& $[0,\\pi/4)$ & $x = \\pi/4$ & $(\\pi/4,\\pi]$\\\\\n$\\displaystyle f'(x)$ & + & 0 & -\\\\\n$\\displaystyle f(x)$ & increasing & max & decreasing\\\\\n\\end{longtable}\n\nHence \\emph{f(x)} has a maximum at \\emph{x = $\\pi$/4}."
