        "The stationary probability density, $\\bar{\\mathbf{p}}$, satisfies the\nequation:\n\n\\[\\bar{\\mathbf{p}} = P\\bar{\\mathbf{p}}.\\] We notice that\n$\\bar{\\mathbf{p}}$ must be the eigenvector with corresponding eigenvalue\n$\\lambda = 1$. Thus, we need to solve for this eigenvector (making sure\nall the entries sum to 1 in order for it to be a probability\ndistribution) using the equation $(P - I)\\bar{\\mathbf{p}} = \\mathbf{0}$\n\n\\[\\begin{bmatrix}\n-3/4  &  1/4  &  1/4\\\\\n3/4  &  -1/4  &  1/4\\\\\n0  &  0  &  -1/2\n\\end{bmatrix}\\bar{\\mathbf{p}} = \\mathbf{0} \\quad \\rightarrow \\quad \n\\bar{\\mathbf{p}} = \\begin{bmatrix}1/4 \\\\ 3/4 \\\\ 0\\end{bmatrix}.\\]\n\nTherefore, the stationary probabilities are probability 1/4 of being in\nstate 1, probability 3/4 of being in state 2, and zero probability of\nbeing in state 3."
