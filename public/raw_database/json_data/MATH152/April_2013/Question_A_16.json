    "statement": "Let \\emph{A} and \\emph{B} be two $n\\times n$ matrices and let \\emph{v}\nbe a non-zero vector in $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$. Given that $Av = Bv$, can we\nconclude that $A = B$? Justify your answer.",

        "There is a small subtlety in this problem. Suppose first that $n=1$.\nThen $Av = Bv$ becomes an equation of real numbers, as \\emph{1x1}\nmatrices are just one number, and a \\emph{v} is also just one number.\nThis gives $(A-B)v = 0$ and as $v \\neq 0$ (the problem stated this was\nnot zero) we have that $A=B$.\n\nNow, for $\\displaystyle n=2$, suppose that\n\n\\begin{align*}A = \\begin{bmatrix}1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}\\end{align*}\n\nand let $\\displaystyle B = -A$, Then\n\n\\begin{align*}A-B = \\begin{bmatrix}2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}\\end{align*}\n\nLet\n\n\\begin{align*}v = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix}\\end{align*}\n\nThen this vector is in the nullspace of both matrices, \\emph{Av = 0 =\nBv}, but $A \\neq B$ and hence the claim is not true for $n=2$.\n\nNext, suppose that \\emph{n} is at least 3. We can generalize the above\nexample nicely. Choose \\emph{A} to be the all zeroes matrix except with\na 1 in the position $A_{1,1}$ (the top left corner) and let $B = -A$ so\nthat it too has all zeroes except a -1 in the top left corner. Then\n$A-B$ has only a 2 in the top left corner and zeroes everywhere else.\nLastly, let\n\n\\begin{align*}v = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix}\\end{align*}\n\nThen notice that $Av = 0 = Bv$ however $A \\neq B$. Thus, the claim is\nfalse for all $n\\geq 2$ but is true when $n=1$."

    "hints": [
        "If we isolate for 0, we get\n\n$\\displaystyle 0 = Av - Bv = (A-B)v$\n\nso $A=B$ could be true but it seems like there are other cases to\nconsider. See if you can find a counter example.", 
        "Watch out for the $n=1$ case as it is an exception. This is the case\nwhere you deal with real numbers instead of matrices (real numbers are\njust $1\\times 1$ matrices)", 
        "Lastly, to help with the counter example, find matrices \\emph{A} and\n\\emph{B} so that $A-B$ has nontrivial nullspace."
