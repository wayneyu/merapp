        "Yes, it is true that the nullspace of the incidence matrix (D) is equal\nto the nullspace of the Laplacian matrix. The reason for this is that\nthe Laplacian matrix represents the total current flowing into or out of\na node\\begin{align*}L = D^{T} R^{-1} D\\end{align*} According to Kirchoff$^{\\prime}$s Current\nLaw, current flowing into a node must equal to the current flowing out\nof the node, there cannot be a buildup of current at any node if there\nare no batteries attached, which there isn$^{\\prime}$t in this question.\nThis can be expressed as\\begin{align*}L \\vec{v} = 0\\end{align*}\n\nFor this to be true, $\\vec{v} = \\vec{1}$ because current flow has to be\n0. For current flow to be equal to 0, you would have to have a voltage\ndifference of 0, meaning that the voltage at each node is exactly the\nsame, Therefore\\begin{align*}N(L) = N(D) = span(\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n\n1 \\\\\n\n1 \\\\\n\n1\n\n\\end{bmatrix})\\end{align*}"
