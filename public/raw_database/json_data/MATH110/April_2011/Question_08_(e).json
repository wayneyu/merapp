        "We find the second derivative of $f$ by using the quotient rule on the\nfirst derivative:\n\n\\begin{align*}\nf''(x) &= \\frac{2(x^2 - 4) - 2x(2x)}{(x^2 - 4)^2} \\\\\n&= \\frac{-2x^2 - 8}{(x^2 - 4)^2} \\end{align*}\n\nWe find possible inflection points by setting $\\displaystyle f''(x)$\nequal to zero and also by determining where it is undefined. In this\ncase, $\\displaystyle f''$ is never zero and is undefined when\n$x = -2, 2$. Because these points are not included in our domain,\n\\emph{$f$} has no inflection points, i.e. \\emph{$f$} does not change its\nconcavity. Therefore, it suffices to find the concavity at any point in\nthe domain, e.g. at \\emph{x = 0}:\n\n\\begin{align*}f''(0) = \\frac{-8}{16} < 0\\end{align*}\n\nand hence \\emph{$f$} is concave down on its whole domain."
