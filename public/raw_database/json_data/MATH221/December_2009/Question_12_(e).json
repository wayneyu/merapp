        "\\textbf{True}. For a matrix to be diagnonizable, it must be able to be\nwritten in this form\\[A = P^{-1} D P\\] where D is a matrix with the\neigenvalues of A as its diagonal. All projection matrices to the same\ndimension are diagonizable. Since all vectors in W project onto itself\nwith that transformation, the eigenvalues of T are 0 and 1, hence\n$P^{-1}D^n P = A$."
