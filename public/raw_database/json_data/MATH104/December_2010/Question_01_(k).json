        "On the closed interval $[-1,8]$, the global maximum/minimum can occur at\ncritical points or at the endpoints.\n\nIf $f(x) = x^{2/3}$, then $f'(x) = \\frac{2}{3} x^{-1/3}$ which is never\n$0$ but is undefined at $x=0$. The only critical point on the interval\nis at $x=0$.\n\nNow we evaluate $f$ at the critical point and at the\nendpoints\\begin{align*}f(0) = 0,\\end{align*} $f(-1) = (-1)^{2/3} = 1$, and\n$f(8) = 8^{2/3} = 4$.\n\nIn comparing these we find the global maximum is $4$ occurring at $x=8$\nand the global minimum is $0$ occurring at $x=0$."
