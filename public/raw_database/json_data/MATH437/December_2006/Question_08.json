    "statement": "Suppose that the positive integer \\emph{n} satisfies\n$\\displaystyle 2^{n} \\equiv -1 \\mod{n}$. Let \\emph{p} be the smallest\nprime divisor of \\emph{n}. Show that $\\displaystyle p = 3$.",

        "Note that $\\displaystyle 2^{n}+1$ is odd for all values of \\emph{n} so\nthe smallest prime factor must be odd. Then further,\n$\\displaystyle 2^{p-1} \\equiv 1 \\mod{p}$ by Fermat's Little Theorem.\nFrom the given, we know that $\\displaystyle 2^{n} \\equiv -1 \\mod{p}$ and\nthus\n\n$\\displaystyle 2^{2n} \\equiv (2^{n})^{2} \\equiv (-1)^{2} \\equiv 1 \\mod{p}$\n\nHence the order of 2 must be a divisor of\n$\\displaystyle d = \\gcd(2n,p-1)$ (you can see this by using the\nEuclidean algorithm to find an \\emph{a} and a \\emph{b} so that\n$\\displaystyle a(p-1) + bn = d$ and then noting that\n$\\displaystyle 2^{d} = 2^{a(p-1) + bn} \\equiv 1 \\mod{p}$). As \\emph{p}\nis the smallest prime factor of \\emph{n} and as noted it is odd, we see\nthat $\\displaystyle \\gcd(2n,p-1)=2$. Since clearly\n$\\displaystyle 2 \\equiv 1 \\mod{p}$ is false, we see that\n$\\displaystyle 4 = 2^{2} \\equiv 1 \\mod{p}$ which happens only when\n$\\displaystyle p=3$ as required."
