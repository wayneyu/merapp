        "The function $\\ln(x)$ is defined for all $x > 0$. Therefore, in order\nfor $\\ln(4 - x^2)$ to be defined, we need $4 - x^2 > 0$. If we factor\nthe left side of the inequality, we get\n\n\\begin{align*}\\displaystyle (2 - x)(2 + x) > 0\\end{align*}\n\nFor what values of x is this inequality true?\n\nIf $x = 2$ or \\emph{-2}, then the left side of the inequality is zero,\nwhich is not allowed. So 2 and -2 cannot be part of our domain.\nSimilarly, if $x > 2$ or $x < -2$, then the left side of the inequality\nwill be negative, contradicting the inequality. So these values are also\nexcluded from our domain. If we choose $-2 < x < 2$ we find that the\nleft hand side of the inequality is positive, satisfying the inequality.\nThus our domain is $-2 < x < 2$, which written in interval notation is\n$\\displaystyle (-2, 2)$."
