        "Since $x^{1/3}$ is an odd function and $\\cos(x)$ is an even function, we\nknow that their product is an odd function. More directly, notice that\nif\n\n\\begin{align*}\\displaystyle f(x) = x^{1/3}\\cos(x)\\, dx\\end{align*}\n\nthen\n\n\\begin{align*}\\displaystyle f(-x) = (-x)^{1/3}\\cos(-x) = -x^{1/3}\\cos(x) = -f(x)\\end{align*}\n\nand so the function is odd. As the interval of integration is symmetric,\nwe have that\n\n\\begin{align*}\\int_{-2012}^{2012}x^{1/3}\\cos(x)\\, dx = 0.\\end{align*}"
