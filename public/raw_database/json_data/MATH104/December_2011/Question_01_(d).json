        "The following solution makes use of the product rule, rather than the\nquotient rule, for differentiation. Writing the given function as:\n\n\\begin{align*}\\displaystyle y(x) = (x+3)(2x+1)^{-1}\\end{align*}\n\nallows us to apply the product rule when taking the derivative:\n\n\\begin{align*}\\frac{dy}{dx} =y'(x) = \\frac{1}{2x+1} - \\frac{2x+6}{(2x+1)^2}\\end{align*}\n\nAt \\emph{x} = 0, the derivative of \\emph{y} is equal to\n\n\\begin{align*}y'(0) &= \\frac{1}{2(0)+1} - \\frac{2(0)+6}{(2(0)+1)^2} \\\\\n&= 1 - 6 \\\\\n&= -5\\end{align*}\n\nThe general ``point-slope form'' for the equation of a straight line is\n\n\\begin{align*}\\displaystyle y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)\\end{align*}\n\nwhere (\\emph{x}\\textsubscript{1},\\emph{y}\\textsubscript{1}) is a point\non the line with slope \\emph{m}. We choose \\emph{x}\\textsubscript{1} = 0\nand hence \\emph{y}\\textsubscript{1} = \\emph{y}(0) = 3. Plugging in these\nvalues yields\n\n\\begin{align*}y - y(0) &= (-5)(x - 0) \\\\\ny -3 &= -5x \\\\\ny&= -5x +3\\end{align*}\n\nTherefore, the required equation is \\emph{y} = -5\\emph{x} +3."
