The temperature of the body at 10:00 P.M. was\n33$^{\\circ}$C and one hour later it was 31$^{\\circ}$C. The temperature\nof the room in which the body was found was 21$^{\\circ}$C and normal\nbody temperature is 37$^{\\circ}$C. Assume that the body cools after\ndeath according to Newton's Law of Cooling.\n\nDid the murder occur before 9:00 P.M.? Please justify your answer.",

        "We know from\n\\href{Science:Math_Exam_Resources/Courses/MATH100/December_2011/Question_2_(a)}{Question\n2 (a)} that the police arrived -ln(4/3)/ln(5/6) hours after the murder\n(we add a negative sign because we look at this as a positive amount of\ntime now).\n\nSo the question is whether -ln(4/3)/ln(5/6) is larger than 1 or not.\nLet's see if this is meaningful or not. We know that ln(\\emph{x}) is\npositive if \\emph{x} is larger than 1. So ln(4/3) is positive and\nln(5/6) is negative. Since -ln(5/6) = ln(6/5), we can say that the\n(positive) amount of time it took for the police to get to the crime\nscene is ln(4/3)/ln(6/5).\n\nWhich of 4/3 or 6/5 is larger? Well, they are the same as 20/15 and\n18/15 respectively, so the denominator is smaller than the numerator and\nlikewise if we take a logarithm, hence ln(4/3) \\textgreater{} ln(6/5)\nand so\n\n\\[\\displaystyle\n\\frac{\\ln(4/3)}{\\ln(6/5)} > 1\\] which means that the police arrived MORE\nthan an hour after the murder, that is, the murder took place BEFORE\n9:00PM."

When\ndid the police arrive?\n\nSince you do not have access to a calculator during the exam, how can\nyou evaluate ln(4/3)/ln(5/6) without a calculator?"
