        "The functions $\\displaystyle \\sin(x)$ and $\\displaystyle e^x$ are both\ncontinuous everywhere. Further, the function in the denominator,\n$\\displaystyle e^x$, is never 0. Hence $\\displaystyle f(x)$ is\ncontinuous everywhere and thus there are no vertical asymptotes."

    "hints": [
        "Recall that $\\displaystyle a$ is a candidate for a vertical asymptote\nonly if $\\displaystyle f(x)$ has a discontinuity at $\\displaystyle a$,\nso that there is a chance that $\\displaystyle f(x)$ tends to\n$\\displaystyle \\infty$ or $\\displaystyle -\\infty$ as $\\displaystyle x$\napproaches $\\displaystyle a$."
