        "We start by calculating the derivative of $f(x)$, using the quotient\nrule:\n\n$f'(x) = \\frac{(x-1) - (x + 1)}{(x-1)^2} = \\frac{-2}{(x-1)^2}$.\n\nThe critical points of the function are the x-values where the\nderivative is either undefined or equal to zero.\n\nThe derivative here is undefined when the denominator is equal to zero.\nSetting the denominator equal to zero...\n\n$(x - 1)^2 = 0$\n\n...and solving for x, we get that $\\displaystyle f'(x)$ is undefined\nwhen $x = 1$.\n\nTo find the remaining critical points, we set the derivative equal to\nzero and try solving for x.\n\n$\\frac{-2}{(x-1)^2} = 0$\n\nAs it turns out, there are no x-values that will satisfy this equation.\nThus our only critical point is at $x = 1$."
