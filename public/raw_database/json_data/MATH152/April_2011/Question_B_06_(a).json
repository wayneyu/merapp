        "For a vector \\textbf{x}, with components $x_1$ and $x_2$, the unique\nsolution is\n\n\\begin{align*}\nx_1&=2,\\\\\nx_2&=3.\n\\end{align*}\n\nSince there is a unique solution all pivots must be 1. Since we have two\nequations in two unknowns we have 2 rows and 2 columns. Therefore the\naugmented matrix would look like\n\n\\[\\left[\\begin{array}{cc|c}\n1  &  0  &  2\\\\\n0  &  1  &  3\n\\end{array}\\right]\\]"

    "hints": [
        "Recall that a unique solution implies there are no free variables; all\npivots are 1."
