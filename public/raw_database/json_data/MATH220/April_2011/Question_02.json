        "\\textbf{Solution to 1.}\n\nThe supremum of this set is 5, since it is clearly larger than any\nnumber in (-1,5) and no number smaller than 5 could have that property.\n(If you're not convinced of this, imagine any number smaller than 5, and\ncall it \\emph{N} then there must exist a number between \\emph{N} and 5\nso that \\emph{N} cannot be the supremum).\n\nAnd for a similar reason, the infimum of this set has to be -1.\n\n\\textbf{Solution to 2.}\n\nHere the set that we are looking at is all the rational numbers that are\nbetween the square root of 3 and the square root of 7. The supremum and\ninfimum of a set do not have to be members of the set, so our intuition\nisn't bad: the supremum has to be the square root of 7 and the infimum\nthe square root of 3.\n\n\\textbf{Solution to 3.}\n\nThis set is the intersection of closed intervals that grow. At $n=1$ it\nis the set {[}3,4{]} and then {[}2.5, 5{]}, so we have\n\n\\[\\displaystyle\n[3,4]\u00c2\u00a0\\cap [2.5,5] \\cap\u00c2\u00a0[2+\\frac{1}{3},6-\\frac{2}{3}] \\cap [2+\\frac{1}{4}, 6-\\frac{2}{4}] \\cap \\ldots = [3,4]\\]\n\nsince because we're taking an intersection of larger and larger\ninterval, only the smaller remains. It is now clear that the supremum of\nthat set is 4 and the infimum 3.\n\n\\textbf{Solution to 4.}\n\nHere the sets also are growing in size, but this time we are taking a\nunion. Since 1/\\emph{n} converges to 0, the left side of the interval\nconverges to 0 and clearly the right side of the interval converges to\ninfinity. This means that\n\n\\[\\displaystyle\n\\bigcup_{n=1}^\\infty [\\frac{1}{n},n] = (0,\\infty)\\]\n\nAnd so the infimum of this set is 0, while there isn't a supremum since\nthe set does not have an upper bound."
