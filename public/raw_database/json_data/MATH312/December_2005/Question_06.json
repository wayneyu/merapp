        "The answer is \\textbf{d = Wednesday}\n\nProceeding as in the hints, we need to compute\n\n$\\displaystyle 10^{200000000000} \\equiv 3^{200000000000} \\mod{7}$\n\nWe use Euler's formula which states that\n\n$3^{\\phi(7)} = 3^{6} \\equiv 1 \\mod{7}$\n\nNext, notice that $\\displaystyle 200000000000$ is not divisible by 6\n(the sum of the digits is not divisible by 3 so the number is not\ndivisible by 3). However $\\displaystyle 200000000004$ is divisible by 6\nand thus, $\\displaystyle 200000000004-6 = 199999999998 = 6s$ is\ndivisible by 6 (here we let \\emph{s} be an integer). Hence\n\n\\begin{align*}\n10^{200000000000} &\\equiv 3^{200000000000}  \\mod{7}\\\\\n&\\equiv 3^{2}\\cdot 3^{199999999998}  \\mod{7}\\\\\n&\\equiv 2\\cdot (3^{6})^{s}  \\mod{7}\\\\\n&\\equiv 2  \\mod{7}\\end{align*}\n\nand thus, two days from Monday is a Wednesday."
