        "Since the growth rate is the derivative of the height for any time\n$t\\geq 0$, we need to integrate the function $g(t)$ to find the height\ndepending on $t$.\n\n$h(t)=\\int g(t)dt=\\int ae^{\\frac{t}{2}}dt = 2ae^{\\frac{t}{2}} + c$\n\nfor a constant $c\\in\\R$.\n\nWe find that constant by using the initial condition.\n\n$0=h(0)=2a + c,$\n\n\\[c=-2a\\].\n\nSo, the function of height is\n\n$h(t)=2a(e^{\\frac{t}{2}}-1)$."
