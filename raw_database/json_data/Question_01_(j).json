        "In this case we need to use logarithmic differentiation, indeed it is\nimpossible to use the power rule since there is an \\emph{x\n\\textsuperscript{2}} as exponent. We cannot differentiate it in the same\nway we do for exponential functions since we take the power of \\emph{x}\nand not \\emph{e} or another constant. Hence we need to use logarithmic\ndifferentiation. First set\n\n\\[y=x^{(x^2)},\\] then taking the logarithm on both sides we find\n\n\\[\\ln y = \\ln (x^{(x^2)}) = x^2 \\ln(x).\\] Now keeping in mind that\n\\emph{y} is a function of \\emph{x}, we can take the derivatives on both\nsides and get\n\n\\[\\frac{d}{dx} \\ln y = \\frac{d}{dx} (x^2 \\ln(x)) .\\] The left-hand side\nis simply\n\n\\[\\frac{d}{dx} \\ln y = \\frac{1}{y} \\cdot \\frac{d}{dx} y = \\frac{1}{y} y',\\]\nwhile the right-hand side gives, using the product rule,\n\n\\[\\frac{d}{dx}(x^2 \\ln(x)) = 2x \\ln(x) + x^2 \\frac{1}{x} =  2x \\ln(x) + x.\\]\nPutting everything back together, we get\n\n\\[\\frac{1}{y} y' = 2x \\ln(x) + x,\\] and thus\n\n\\[\\displaystyle y' = y (2x \\ln(x) + x).\\] Replacing \\emph{y} by\n$x^{(x^2)},$ we finally get\n\n\\[y' = x^{(x^2)} ( 2x \\ln(x) + x).\\]"
