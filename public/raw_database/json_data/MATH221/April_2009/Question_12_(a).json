        "The answer is \\textbf{true}.\n\nThe Cayley Hamilton theorem tells us that the eigenvalues are roots of\n$\\displaystyle q(\\lambda) = \\lambda^{2} + 1 = 0$. Thus, exactly one of\n$\\displaystyle \\lambda+i$ or $\\displaystyle \\lambda-i$ contains an odd\nnumber of factors in the matrix\n$\\displaystyle p(\\lambda) \\text{det}(A-\\lambda I)$. This means the\nconstant term of $\\displaystyle p(\\lambda)$ (which is the product of the\nroots) must be strictly non-real, a contradiction since the matrix was\nassumed to be real."
