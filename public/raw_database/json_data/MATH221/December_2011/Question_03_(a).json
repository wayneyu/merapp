        "Eigenvalues are values of the variable \u03bb such that the system\n\n\\[\\displaystyle\nA-\\lambda I\\] has a non-trivial nullspace or equivalently, when it has\ndeterminant 0.\n\nWe compute this determinant:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n\\det(A-\\lambda I) &= \\left| \\begin{array}{cc}\n-6-\\lambda & 8 \\\\\n-4 & 6-\\lambda\n\\end{array}\\right| \\\\\n&= (-6-\\lambda)(6-\\lambda) - 8(-4) \\\\\n&= -36 + \\lambda^2 + 32 \\\\\n&= \\lambda^2 - 4\n\\end{align*}\n\nAnd so we conclude that this determinant is zero if and only if \u03bb is 2\nor -2. (Note: this equation is called the characteristic polynomial of\nthe linear system).\n\nFor each eigenvalue, an eigenvector is simply a non-trivial solution\n(non-trivial means not zero since that's an obvious solution that is\nalways present).\n\nFor \u03bb = 2 we obtain the system\n\n\\begin{align*}\nA-2I &= \\left[ \\begin{array}{cc}\n-8 & 8 \\\\\n-4 & 4\n\\end{array}\\right] \\\\\n&\\sim \\left[ \\begin{array}{cc}\n1 & -1 \\\\\n0 & 0\n\\end{array}\\right] \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\nAnd so the general solution is a vector of the form {[}\\emph{t},\n\\emph{t} {]}, which means that the eigenspace for the eigenvalue 2 is\nspanned by the vector {[}1, 1{]}.\n\nFor \u03bb = -2 we obtain the system\n\n\\begin{align*}\nA+2I &= \\left[ \\begin{array}{cc}\n-4 & 8 \\\\\n-4 & 8\n\\end{array}\\right] \\\\\n&\\sim \\left[ \\begin{array}{cc}\n1 & -2 \\\\\n0 & 0\n\\end{array}\\right] \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\nAnd so the general solution is a vector of the form {[}2\\emph{t},\n\\emph{t} {]}, which means that the eigenspace for the eigenvalue -2 is\nspanned by the vector {[}2, 1{]}."
