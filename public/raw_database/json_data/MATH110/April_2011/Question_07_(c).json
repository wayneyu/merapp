        "The question is asking us to minimize the area of a triangle. So the\nfunction that we will be minimizing is\n\n\\[A = \\frac12 b h\\]\n\nwhere \\emph{b} is the triangle's base and \\emph{h} is its height. In\norder to optimize (in this case, minimize), we need to reduce this\nformula to a function of one variable.\n\nIf we draw a picture of a line with negative slope that passes through\n(1,1), we will see the triangle formed by the axes and the line and can\nlabel its base and height.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htbp]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=.5\\textwidth]{ScienceMathExamResourcesCoursesMath110April2011Question7cv1.jpg}\n\\caption{ScienceMathExamResourcesCoursesMath110April2011Question7cv1.jpg}\n\\end{figure}\n\nSo the base of the triangle is equal to the distance between 0 and the\nx-intercept of the line (which is simply the value of the x-intercept)\nand similarly, the height is equal to the y-intercept. We calculated the\nx and y intercept in the previous part of the question, so now we can\nsimply plug them into our area formula for \\emph{b} and \\emph{h}.\n\n\\begin{align*}A &= \\frac12 \\left(\\frac{m-1}{m}\\right) (-m+1) \\\\\n&= \\frac{-m^2+2m-1}{2m}\\end{align*}\n\nWe now take the derivative of \\emph{A}...\n\n\\begin{align*}A' &= \\frac{(-2m+2)(2m)-(-m^2+2m - 1)(2)}{4m^2} \\\\\n&= \\frac{-2(m-1)(m)+(m-1)^2}{2m^2} \\\\\n&= \\frac{(m-1)(-2m+m-1)}{2m^2} \\\\\n&= \\frac{(m-1)(-m-1)}{2m^2} \\end{align*}\n\n...and find its critical points. The derivative is undefined when\n$m = 0$. Setting it equal to zero:\n\n\\[0 = \\frac{(m-1)(-m-1)}{2m^2}\\]\n\n\\[0 = (m - 1)(-m -1)\\]\n\nyields additional critical points of $m = -1,$ and $m = 1$. However, as\nstated in the question, $m < 0$, so the only valid critical point is\n$m = -1$. To check that this is a minimum, you could use the first or\nsecond derivative test."
