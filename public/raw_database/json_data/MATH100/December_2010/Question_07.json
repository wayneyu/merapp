Computing the third\nderivative via the product rule gives\n\n\\begin{align*}\nf(x) &= e^{x}(x^{2} - 7x + 15) \\\\\nf'(x) &= e^{x}(x^{2} - 7x + 15) + e^{x}(2x - 7) \\\\\n&= e^{x}(x^{2} - 7x + 15 + 2x - 7) \\\\\n&= e^{x}(x^{2} - 5x + 8) \\\\\nf''(x) &= e^{x}(x^{2} - 5x + 8) + e^{x}(2x - 5) \\\\\n&= e^{x}(x^{2} - 5x + 8 + 2x - 5) \\\\\n&= e^{x}(x^{2} - 3x + 3) \\\\\nf'''(x) &= e^{x}(x^{2} - 3x + 3) + e^{x}(2x - 3) \\\\\n&= e^{x}(x^{2} - 3x + 3 + 2x - 3) \\\\\n&= e^{x}(x^{2} - x) \\end{align*}\n\nNotice that $\\displaystyle e^{x}$ is increasing on $\\displaystyle [0,1]$\nand thus obtains its maximum at \\emph{x = 1}, i.e.\n\n\\begin{align*}|e^x| = e^x \\leq e^1 = e\\end{align*}\n\nfor $x \\in [0,1]$.\n\nThe function $\\displaystyle x^{2} - x$ is a parabola with roots at 0 and\n1. Hence its minimum occurs at the midpoint of the roots, namely at\n$\\displaystyle x = 1/2$. Since the value at the endpoints \\emph{x = 0}\nand \\emph{x = 1} is zero, the minimum value of the parabola maximizes\nits absolute value. Thus,\n\n\\begin{align*}\\displaystyle |x^{2} - x| \\leq |(1/2)^{2} - (1/2)| = 1/4\\end{align*}\n\nSince we want to bound the absolute value of the third derivative, we\nknow that\n\n\\begin{align*}\\displaystyle  |f'''(x)| = |e^x| |x^2-x| \\leq e \\cdot 1/4 = e/4 = M.\\end{align*}\n\nHence, we have\n\n\\begin{align*}\\displaystyle  |T_{2}(1) - f(1)| \\leq  \\frac{M}{6} = \\frac{e}{24}\\end{align*}\n\nas required.", 
        "Proceed as in solution 1 to see that\n\n\\begin{align*}\nf'''(x) &= e^{x}(x^{2} - x) \\end{align*}\n\nWe now need a bound on this function on $\\displaystyle [0,1]$. Notice\nthat the third derivative is neither monotonically increasing nor is it\nmonotonically decreasing on the interval. Hence we are not guaranteed to\nfind the maximum value by just looking at the endpoints. In fact, at the\nendpoints we have $\\displaystyle f'''(0) = 0 = f'''(1)$, which is\ncertainly not the maximum of the absolute value\n$\\displaystyle |f'''(x)|$. Instead we do it the proper way: Take the\nderivative\n\n\\begin{align*}\\displaystyle f''''(x) = e^{x}(x^{2}-x) + e^{x}(2x-1) = e^{x}(x^{2}+x-1)\\end{align*}\n\nand set it to zero\n\n\\begin{align*}\\displaystyle 0 = e^{x}(x^{2}+x-1)\\end{align*}\n\nRecall that $\\displaystyle e^{x} \\neq 0$. Using the quadratic formula,\nwe see that\n\n\\begin{align*}\\displaystyle x = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{1^{2} - 4(1)(-1)}}{2(1)} = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{5}}{2}\\end{align*}\n\nonly the positive such root is in $\\displaystyle [0,1]$. Let\n\n\\begin{align*}\\displaystyle  \\phi := \\frac{-1 + \\sqrt{5}}{2}.\\end{align*}\n\nThen, our function $\\displaystyle f'''(x)$ obtains an extreme value at\n$\\displaystyle \\phi$. Since the function is nonzero at this point, we\nknow that $\\displaystyle |f'''(x)|$ is maximal at $\\displaystyle \\phi$.\nThus, we have that\n\n\\begin{align*}\\displaystyle  |T_{2}(1) - f(1)| \\leq \\frac{M}{6} = \\frac{|f'''(\\phi)|}{6} = \\frac{e^\\phi|\\phi^2-\\phi|}6\\end{align*}\n\ncompleting the solution."
