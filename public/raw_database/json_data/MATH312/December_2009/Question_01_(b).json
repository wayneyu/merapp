        "Using long division, we see that\n\n$\\displaystyle a^{2} + b^{2} = (a+b)(a-b) + 2b^{2}$\n\nand thus, the Euclidean algorithm states that\n\n$\\displaystyle \\gcd(a^{2} + b^{2},a+b) = (a+b, 2b^{2})$.\n\nNow, as \\emph{a} and \\emph{b} are coprime, we see that\n\n$\\displaystyle \\gcd(a^{2} + b^{2},a+b) = (a+b, 2b^{2}) = (a+b,2)$. If\nthis were not true then some factor of \\emph{b} would divide\n$\\displaystyle a+b$ and that means that this factor would also divide\n\\emph{a} which means that the factor must have been 1 since \\emph{a} and\n\\emph{b} were coprime. Finally, it's clear that $(a+b,2)$ is 1 or 2.\nThis completes the proof."
