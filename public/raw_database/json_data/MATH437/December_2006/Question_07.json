        "We proceed as in the hints. We factor the left hand side in\n$\\displaystyle \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-11})$ as\n\n$\\displaystyle (y + \\sqrt{-11})(y - \\sqrt{-11}) = x^{3}$.\n\nSince $\\displaystyle -11 \\equiv 1 \\mod{4}$, the ring of integers here is\ngiven by $\\mathbb{Z}\\left[\\frac{1+\\sqrt{-11}}{2} \\right]$ which is a\nunique factorization domain. We compute the greatest common divisor of\nthe terms on the left hand side.\n\nLet $\\displaystyle I = (y + \\sqrt{-11},y - \\sqrt{-11})$, the ideal\ngenerated by these two elements. Now notice that in the equation\n$\\displaystyle y^{2} = x^{3} - 11$, if \\emph{x} is even, then modulo 8\nconsiderations show that $\\displaystyle y^{2} \\equiv 5 \\mod{8}$ and this\nis a contradiction since the only odd square is 1 modulo 8. Thus,\n\\emph{x} is odd and so \\emph{y} is even.\n\nWe may further suppose that these factors are coprime for otherwise, if\na prime \\emph{p} divides both \\emph{x} and \\emph{y}, then it must divide\n11 and hence must equal 11. Rewriting the equation would then give\n\n$\\displaystyle (11y')^{2} + 11 = (11x')^{3}$\n\nor simplified\n\n$\\displaystyle 11(y')^{2} + 1 = 121(x')^{3}$\n\nand hence 11 divides 1 which is a contradiction. So \\emph{y} is even and\n\\emph{x} and \\emph{y} are coprime. Further, we have that\n\n$\\displaystyle (y + \\sqrt{-11})(y - \\sqrt{-11}) = x^{3} \\in I$\n\nand that\n\n$\\displaystyle y + \\sqrt{-11} + y - \\sqrt{-11} = 2y \\in I$\n\nHence $1 = \\gcd(x,y) \\in I$ and thus, the two elements\n$y + \\sqrt{-11},y - \\sqrt{-11}$ are coprime. Thus, we may write\n\n$\\displaystyle y + \\sqrt{-11} = \\pm\\left(\\frac{\\alpha' + \\beta' \\sqrt{-11}}{2}\\right)^{3} = \\left(\\frac{\\alpha + \\beta \\sqrt{-11}}{2}\\right)^{3}$\n\nwhere above, the right hand side absorbs the units since\n$\\pm 1 = (\\pm 1)^{3}$ (and we relabeled the\n$\\displaystyle \\alpha', \\beta'$ values) where\n$\\displaystyle \\alpha,\\beta \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nExpanding and comparing coefficients yields\n\n\\begin{align*} \n8y &= \\alpha^{3} - 33 \\alpha\\beta^{2} \\\\\n8\\sqrt{-11}  &= (3\\alpha^{2}\\beta - 11\\beta^{3}) \\sqrt{-11}\\end{align*}\n\nor simplified\n\n\\begin{align*} \n8y &= \\alpha^{3} - 33 \\alpha\\beta^{2}  \\\\\n8 &= \\beta(3\\alpha^{2} - 11\\beta^{2})\\end{align*}\n\nThe second equation tells us that\n$\\displaystyle \\beta \\in \\{\\pm1,\\pm2,\\pm4,\\pm8\\}$ since it must be a\nfactor of 8. Checking these 8 values shows that only\n$\\displaystyle \\beta = -1$ or $\\displaystyle \\beta = 2$ gives admissable\nvalues. This leads to the points\n\n$\\displaystyle (\\alpha, \\beta) = (\\pm 1,-1)$ or\n$\\displaystyle (\\alpha, \\beta) = (\\pm4,2)$\n\nThe first point gives $y = \\mp4$ and the second point yields\n$y = \\mp 29$. These correspond to the given points and thus complete the\nproblem."
