        "Euler's formula states that for a complex number given in argument form,\nwe have\n\n\\[\\displaystyle\n\\cos(\\theta) + i\\sin(\\theta) = e^{i\\theta}\\]\n\nIn the case of the complex number\n\n\\[z = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} + \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}i\\] we can either see that\nthis corresponds to the point at distance 1 of the origin on the\ndiagonal in the first quadrant of the complex plan and hence has an\nargument of 45$^{\\circ}$ or of $\\pi$/4; or you might directly remember the\nvalues of the sine and cosine of $\\pi$/4. Either way, we obtain that\n\n\\[z = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} + \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}i = \\cos(\\pi /4) + i \\sin(\\pi /4) = e^{i\\pi / 4}\\]\n\nTaking the 2010 of $z$ is much easier in this shape. We have\n\n\\[\\displaystyle\nz^{2010} = (e^{i\\pi /4})^{2010} = e^{i1005\\pi / 2}\\]\n\nIn this notation we see that the argument of $z^{2010}$ is $1005\\pi / 2$\nwhich remains the same if we remove or add $4\\pi /2$, so since\n$2005 = 4\\cdot 501 + 1$ we have that the angle $1005\\pi / 2 = \\pi/2$ and\nso Using Euler's formula again yields\n\n\\[\\displaystyle\nz^{2010} = e^{(1005)i\\pi /2} = e^{i\\pi / 2}\\]\n\nUsing Euler's formula the other way around we obtain that\n\n\\[\\displaystyle\nz^{2010} = e^{i\\pi / 2} = \\cos(\\pi/2) + i\\sin(\\pi/2) = i\\] Since\n$\\cos(\\pi/2) = 0$ and $\\sin(\\pi/2) = 1$."
