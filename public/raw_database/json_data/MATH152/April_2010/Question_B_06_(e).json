        "The answer will be that \\emph{(0, 0, 1)} is outside of \\emph{T}. There\ncan be many different ways to show this, and it takes a correct\nformulation of a \\emph{decisive} criterion and then patience and\ncarefulness to work till the end.\n\nFor the subsequent paragraphs, let us denote\n$\\vec{OA} = (0, 1, 2), \\vec{OB} = (-1, 2, 2), \\vec{OC} = (1, 1, 5)$ for\nbrevity.\n\nThis solution explores the parametrization method. This method is\nsomewhat a more sophisticated but it works beautifully.\n\nStarting from point \\emph{A}, we can travel to \\emph{B} and \\emph{C} by\nthe vectors\n\n\\[\\vec{AB} = \\vec{OB} - \\vec{OA} = (-1,2,2) - (0,1,2) = (-1,1,0)\\] and\n\n\\[\\vec{AC} = \\vec{OC} - \\vec{OA} = (1,1,5) - (0,1,2) = (1,0,3)\\]\nrespectively.\n\nTherefore, the expressions\n\n\\[\\vec{OA} + t \\vec{AB}\\]\n\nand\n\n\\[\\vec{OA} + s \\vec{AC}\\]\n\nwith $0 \\leq s,t \\leq 1$, represents all points from A to B and A to C\nrespectively.\n\nIt turns out we can combine them and write:\n\n\\[\\vec{OA} + t \\vec{AB} + s \\vec{AC} = (0,1,2) + t(-1,1,0) + s(1,0,3) = (s-t, 1+t, 2+3s)\\]\n\nwith the \\textbf{extra} requirement that $0 \\leq s+t \\leq 1$ to describe\nall points in the triangle \\emph{T}.\n\nNow $(s-t, 1+t, 2+3s) = (0, 0, -1)$ implies $s=t=-1$ Thus, it's not in\n\\emph{T}.\n\n\\textbf{Remark 1}: \\emph{(0, 0, -1)} is not even a point in the\nparallelogram\\[(s-t, 1+t, 2+3s)\\] with $0 \\leq s,t \\leq 1$)\n\n\\textbf{Remark 2}: The fact that it was solvable for \\emph{s} and\n\\emph{t} shows that the point in the plane \\emph{P}. If it weren't in\nthe plane, e.g. the point \\emph{(0, 0, 1)}, it wouldn't be solvable and\nsome inconsistencies in the linear equations will result.", 
        "The answer will be that \\emph{(0, 0, -1)} is outside of \\emph{T}. There\nare many different possible ways to show this, but they all take a\ncorrect formulation of a \\emph{decisive} criterion and then patience and\ncarefulness to work till the end.\n\nFor this solution, let's explore some methods using basic geometry. We\nwill hardly use the concept of vectors, and so for the subsequent\nparagraphs, let us denote $A = (0,1,2),$ $B = (-1,2,2),$ $C = (1,1,5)$,\nand $D = (0,0,-1)$ for brevity.\n\nThis are a few ways to formulate a criterion to determine whether\n\\emph{D = (0, 0, -1)} is inside or outside \\emph{T}. Here we suggest 2\npossible criteria.\n\nIn both cases, we consider the triangles\n$\\triangle ABD, \\triangle BCD, \\triangle CAD$. There are two\nqualitatively different pictures for \\emph{D} inside or outside\n\\emph{T}.\n\n\\textbf{Need to include the sketch here}\n\n\\textbf{Criterion 1 - Comparing Lengths}\n\nIf \\emph{D} is outside \\emph{T}, then at least one of the lengths\n\\emph{AD}, \\emph{BD} or \\emph{CD} is strictly greater than the largest\nof \\emph{AB}, \\emph{BC}, \\emph{CA}.\n\nConversely if \\emph{D} is inside \\emph{T}, then all the lengths\n\\emph{AD}, \\emph{BD} or \\emph{CD} is less than or equal to the largest\nof \\emph{AB}, \\emph{BC}, \\emph{CA}.\n\nNow, we calculate:\n\n\\[AB = |(-1,1,0)| = \\sqrt{2}\\]\n\n\\[BC = |(2,-1,3)| = \\sqrt{14}\\]\n\n\\[CA = |(1,0,3)| = \\sqrt{10}\\]\n\nBut since\n\n\\[DC = |(1,1,6)| = \\sqrt{38}\\], \\emph{D} is outside of \\emph{T}.\n\n\\textbf{Criterion 2 - Compare Areas}\n\nIf \\emph{D} is outside \\emph{T}, then the sum of areas of\n$\\triangle ABD, \\triangle BCD, \\triangle CAD$ is strictly greater than\nthat of $\\triangle ABC$\n\nConversely if \\emph{D} is inside \\emph{T}, then equality holds instead.\n\nWe already knew that area of $T = \\triangle ABC$ is $\\sqrt{19}/2$. Let's\ncalculate the area of $\\triangle BCD$\n\n\\begin{align*}\n\\text{Area}(\\triangle BCD)&= \\frac{1}{2} \\left|\\vec{BD} \\times \\vec{CD} \\right|\\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{2} \\left|(-1,2,3) \\times (1,1,6) \\right|\\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{2} |(9,9,-3)|\\\\\n&= \\frac{3\\sqrt{19}}{2}\n\\end{align*}\n\nSo, without calculating the other areas, we can be sure that \\emph{D} is\noutside of \\emph{T}."

Do not assume any particular order of the\nvertices or relative positions.\n\nAfter the sketch, one needs to construct geometrical figures relating\nthe point \\emph{(0, 0, -1)} to the vertices of the triangle \\emph{T}.\nFor instance, one can consider triangles with this new point as a\nvertex."
