        "One way to evaluate $\\int_0^1 \\frac{1}{x^2 - 5x + 6} dx$ is to use\npartial fractions.\n\nWe note that $x^2 - 5x + 6 = (x-2)(x-3)$, and so we decompose the\nfraction into:\n\n\\[\\frac{1}{(x-2)(x-3)} = \\frac{A}{x-2} + \\frac{B}{x-3}\\] which becomes\n\n\\[\\displaystyle\n1 = A(x-3) + B(x-2)\\] after multiplying through by the common\ndenominator of $(x-2)(x-3)$. If we expand the equation out and find the\ncoefficients of the respective powers of x then:\n\n\\[\\displaystyle\n0x + 1 = (A+B)x + (-3A - 2B)\\]\n\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\itemsep1pt\\parskip0pt\\parsep0pt\n\\item\n  From matching the $x$ coefficients, $A + B = 0$ so $A = -B$.\n\\item\n  From matching the constant coefficients, $-3A - 2B = 1$ which becomes\n  $-3(-B) - 2B = 1$ in using the relation above.\n\\end{itemize}\n\nThis tells us that $B = 1$ and therefore $A = -1$.\n\nThe integral is easy to evaluate now:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n\\int_0^1 \\frac{1}{x^2 - 5x + 6} dx &= \\int_0^1 (\\frac{1}{x-3} - \\frac{1}{x-2}) dx \\\\\n&= [\\ln|x-3| - \\ln|x-2|]|_0^1 \\\\\n&= (\\ln 2 - \\ln 1) - (\\ln 3 - \\ln 2) \\\\\n&= 2 \\ln 2 - \\ln 3\n\\end{align*}\n\nWe used the fact that $\\ln 1 = 0$ above."
