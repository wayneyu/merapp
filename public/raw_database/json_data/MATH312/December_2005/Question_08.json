Then there is a prime \\emph{p} such that\n$\\displaystyle p^{2} \\mid n$. Now, in this case, we have\n\n$\\displaystyle p \\mid \\phi(p^{k}) = p^{k-1}(p-1)$\n\nwhere $\\displaystyle k \\geq 2$. Further, write\n$\\displaystyle n = p^{k}m$ where \\emph{m} is coprime to \\emph{p}. Then\n\n$\\displaystyle \\phi(p^{k}) \\mid \\phi(p^{k})\\phi(m) = \\phi(p^{k}m) = \\phi(n)$.\n\nHence\n\n$\\displaystyle p \\mid \\phi(n)$.\n\nHowever $\\displaystyle p \\nmid n-1$ since\n$\\displaystyle n \\equiv 0 \\mod{p}$. Thus,\n$\\displaystyle \\phi(n) \\nmid n-1$ since they do not share the factor of\n\\emph{p}. This is precisely what we wanted to show."
