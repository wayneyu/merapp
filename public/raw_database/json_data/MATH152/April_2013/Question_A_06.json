        "Suppose we have three vectors over $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$ say\n\n$\\begin{bmatrix}\na \\\\ b\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\quad\n\\begin{bmatrix}\nc \\\\ d\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\quad \n\\begin{bmatrix}\ne \\\\ f\n\\end{bmatrix}$\n\nfor fixed \\emph{a},\\emph{b},\\emph{c},\\emph{d},\\emph{e},\\emph{f}. These\nvectors are linearly independent if we can write\n\n$x\\begin{bmatrix}\na \\\\ b\n\\end{bmatrix}\n+ \ny\\begin{bmatrix}\nc \\\\ d\n\\end{bmatrix}\n+\nz\\begin{bmatrix}\ne \\\\ f\n\\end{bmatrix}\n= \n\\begin{bmatrix}\n0 \\\\ 0\n\\end{bmatrix}$\n\nand have x=y=z=0 be the only solution. We can write this as a system of\nlinear equations given by:\n\n\\begin{align*}\nxa + yc + ze &= 0\\\\\nxb + yd + zf &= 0\\end{align*}\n\nThis is a system of two equations and three unknowns (given by\n\\emph{x},\\emph{y}, and \\emph{z}). This always has a nontrivial solution\n(i.e. for any value of z, I can always find an x and y that solve this)\nand therefore x=y=z=0 is not the only solution. The answer then is that\n3 vectors are always linearly dependent in $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$"
