        "It will be complicated to simply plug our expressions for $y'$ and $y''$\ninto the formula for curvature. Instead it might be wiser to calculate\nthe actual value of $y'$ and $y''$ at the point $(1,1)$.\n\nFor $y'$ we have\n\n\\[y' = \\frac{-(1)^3}{(1)^3} = -1\\]\n\nAnd for $y''$ we have\n\n\\[y'' = \\frac{3(1)^2(-(1) + (1)(-1))}{(1)^4} = -6\\]\n\nPlugging these values of $y' = -1$ and $y'' = 6$ into the formula for\n\\emph{K} we get:\n\n\\[K = \\frac{-6}{(1 + (-1)^2)^{3/2}} = \\frac{-6}{2^{3/2}} = \\frac{-3}{\\sqrt{2}}.\\]"
