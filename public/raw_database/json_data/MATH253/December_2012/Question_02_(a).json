    "statement": "Let $\\alpha$ be the acute angle between the plane $z = 4x + 2y$ and the\nplane tangent to the surface $z = x^{2} + y^{2}$ at the point (1,2,5).\nFind $\\cos(\\alpha)$.",

        "The angle between two planes is equal to the angle between their normal\nvectors. Using the hint, we remember that the angle $\\alpha$ between two\nvectors u, v satisfies\n\n\\[\\mathbf{u}\\cdot \\mathbf{v} = \\Vert \\mathbf{u} \\Vert \\Vert \\mathbf{v} \\Vert \\cos(\\alpha) \\quad \\rightarrow \\quad \\cos(\\alpha) = \\frac{\\mathbf{u}\\cdot \\mathbf{v}}{\\Vert \\mathbf{u} \\Vert \\Vert \\mathbf{v} \\Vert}\\]\nwhere $\\Vert \\mathbf{u} \\Vert$ denotes the length of vector u.\n\nThe normal vector to the plane $4x + 2y = z$ is (-4,-2,1). To determine\nthe vector normal to the surface $z = x^{2} + y^{2}$ at (1,2,5), we\ncompute the gradient of the function $f(x,y,z) = x^{2} + y^{2} - z$ and\nevaluate it at the point (1,2,5),\n\n\\[\\nabla f(x,y,z) = (2x,2y,-1) \\quad \\rightarrow \\quad \\nabla f(1,2,5) = (2,4,-1)\\]\nUsing the formula above, we compute $\\cos(\\alpha)$,\n\n\\[\\cos(\\alpha) = \\frac{(2,4,-1)\\cdot(-4,-2,1)}{\\sqrt{4 + 16 + 1}\\sqrt{16 + 4 + 1}} = \\frac{-17}{21}\\]\nNotice that the sign of $\\cos(\\alpha)$ is negative, which implies an\nobtuse angle between the vectors. This may seem like a problem, but\nrecall that every plane has two normal vectors which point in opposite\ndirections. If we take the negative of either $\\nabla f(1,2,5)$ or the\nnormal vector to the plane $4x + 2y = z$ and use it in our calculation\nfor $\\cos(\\alpha)$, we get the positive result:\n\n\\[\\color{blue}{\\cos(\\alpha) = \\frac{17}{21}}.\\]"
