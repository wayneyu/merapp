    "statement": "You bought a rare stamp collection for 10 million dollars. The\nauctioneer who sold it to you estimated its value would increase at 12\\%\nper year, compounded continuously. If you want to wait until the\ncollection has tripled in value before you sell, how many years will you\nbe waiting?",

        "Let the value of the stamp collection at time \\emph{t} be\n\\emph{v}(\\emph{t}), and the time at which the collection was purchased\nbe time \\emph{t} = 0. Then\n\n\\begin{align*}\\displaystyle v(0) = 10\\end{align*}\n\nmillion dollars, and\n\n\\begin{align*}\\displaystyle v(t) = 10 e^{0.12t}.\\end{align*}\n\nIf we wait until the collection has tripled in value, then we would be\nwaiting until $v(t) = 30$ million dollars.\n\nSo, we solve the following equation for \\emph{t}:\n\n\\begin{align*} \n30 &= 10 e^{0.12t} \\\\\n3 &= e^{0.12t} \\\\\n\\ln(3) &= 0.12t \\\\\nt &= \\frac{\\ln(3)}{0.12}\\end{align*}\n\nTherefore, we'll be waiting\n\n\\begin{align*}t = \\frac{\\ln(3)}{0.12}\\end{align*}\n\nyears.\n\n\\textbf{Note:} This is a little more than 9 years. Also, using the rules\nof logarithms, we could also express the solution as\n\n\\begin{align*}\\displaystyle t = \\ln(3^{25/3})\\end{align*}\n\nWhether this simplification would be necessary is up to your instructor."
