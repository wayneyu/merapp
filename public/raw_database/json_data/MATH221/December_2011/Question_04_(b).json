        "\\textbf{Step 1.} If \\emph{v} is an eigenvector for a matrix \\emph{A} for\nsome eigenvalue \u03bb, then we can write\n\n\\begin{align*}\\displaystyle\nAv = \\lambda v\\end{align*}\n\n\\textbf{Step 2.} Since we assume that the matrix \\emph{A} is invertible,\nwe can multiply on the above equation by that inverse on the left on\neach side and obtain\n\n\\begin{align*}\\displaystyle\nA^{-1}Av = A^{-1}\\lambda v\\end{align*} Which is equivalent to\n\n\\begin{align*}\\displaystyle\nv = \\lambda A^{-1} v\\end{align*}\n\n\\textbf{Step 3.} We would now like to divide by \u03bb, but before we should\ncheck that this is allowed, i.e. that \u03bb is not zero. Since \\emph{A} in\ninvertible, \\emph{Aw = 0 = 0(w)} implies \\emph{w = 0}. Thus \u03bb = 0 is\n\\textbf{not} an eigenvalue for \\emph{A} and we can safely bring \u03bb to the\nLHS in the equation above. This yields\n\n\\begin{align*}\\displaystyle\n\\frac{1}{\\lambda}v = A^{-1} v\\end{align*} which would mean that \\emph{v} is an\neigenvector for the eigenvalue 1/\u03bb of the inverse of the matrix\n\\emph{A}. So we can conclude that the statement is \\textbf{true}."
