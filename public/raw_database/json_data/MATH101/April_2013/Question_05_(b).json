        "Note that we do not need to know the density, since it cancels out\nlater. First, we calculate the area by adding the areas of the rectangle\nand semicircle:\n\n\\[\\displaystyle \nA = 6 \\cdot 2 + \\frac{1}{2}\\pi \\cdot3^2 = 12+\\frac{9}{2}\\pi\\]\n\nWe identify the endpoints of the integral as $[-3,3]$, the top function\nas $\\sqrt{3^2-x^2}$ and the bottom function as $-2$.
