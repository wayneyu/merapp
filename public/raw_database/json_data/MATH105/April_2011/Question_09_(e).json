        "As the hint suggests, we can check each equation with the point (0,0,0),\nwhich lies on the surface. The point (0,0,0) does not lie on the surface\ngiven by $x^2+y^2+z^2=1$, so we can rule that out.\n\nSince the surface takes negative $z$ values and $z=x^2 +y^2$ only takes\nnon-negative values, we can rule this out as an option as well.\n\nFinally, we notice that the surface is symmetric about the $x,y$ plane\n(this means that for a given (x,y) we get a value z above the xy-plane\nand the same value (but negative), -z below the xy-plane. For this\nreason, we can rule out $z=x^2-y^2$ since for a given (x,y) we only\nproduce one z value.\n\nThus the surface is $z^2=x^2+y^2$.\n\nWe can check that this solution makes sense by solving the equation for\n$z$ to get $z=\\pm \\sqrt{x^2+y^2}$. The two solutions give identical\nsurfaces above and below the $x,y$ plane, the point (0,0,0) does indeed\nlie on the surface $z^2=x^2+y^2$, and as $x$ and $y$ increase, so does\n$z$. These all match the given graph.\n\nThe level curve at $z=2$ is what we would see if we sliced into the\nsurface horizontally at $z=2$ and looked at it from above. We can find\nthe equation by substituting into the equation for the\nsurface\\[2^2=x^2+y^2\\]. This is simply a circle of radius $2$, the graph\nas follows:\n\n\\begin{figure}[htbp]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=.5\\textwidth]{Math_Exam_Resources_Courses_MATH105_April_2011_Question_9_(e)_picture.jpg}\n\\caption{Math\\_Exam\\_Resources\\_Courses\\_MATH105\\_April\\_2011\\_Question\\_9\\_(e)\\_picture.jpg}\n\\end{figure}"

        "Try to rule out some possibilities by considering whether the 4\nfunctions given satisfy some basic properties which the surface clearly\nsatisfies, i.e.: the point (0,0,0) is on the surface, the surface takes\non negative $z$ values and is symmetric about the $x, y$ plane."
