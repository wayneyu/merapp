    "statement": "Three identical fields of size one hectare are planted with different\namounts of three kinds of wheat (types 1, 2 and 3). The first field is\ndivided in three equal parts with one type of wheat planted on each\npart. It yields 12 tons of total harvest. The second field is divided in\ntwo equal parts with type 2 planted on one part and type 3 planted on\nthe other. It yields 10 tons. The third field is divided in two equal\nparts with type 1 planted on one part and type 2 on the other. It yields\n16 tons.\n\nSolve the system above using Gaussian elimination on the augmented\nmatrix. What is the yield in tons per hectare for each type of wheat?",

        "We take our augmented matrix from\n\\href{Science:Math_Exam_Resources/Courses/MATH152/April_2011/Question_B1_(b)}{part\n(b)} and we put it into reduced row-echelon form. Recall that this\nprocedure ensures that every entry above and below a pivot is a zero. We\ncould also just do a row-echelon form which ensure that only numbers\nbelow pivots are zero. However, for the purpose of example we will\nhighlight the full reduced row-echelon form step by step.\n\nWe start with the augmented matrix\n\n\\[\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc|c}\n\\frac{1}{3}  &  \\frac{1}{3}  &  \\frac{1}{3}  &  12\\\\\n  &  &  &\\\\\n0  &  \\frac{1}{2}  &  \\frac{1}{2}  &  10\\\\\n  &  &  &\\\\\n\\frac{1}{2}  &  \\frac{1}{2}  &  0  &  16\n\\end{array}\\right]\\]\n\nWe see that the first row can contain a pivot in its first column. We\nset that pivot to 1 by multiplying the first row by 3 (recall that\nelementary row operations do not change the solution to the linear\nsystem).\n\n\\[\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc|c}\n\\frac{1}{3}  &  \\frac{1}{3}  &  \\frac{1}{3}  &  12\\\\\n  &  &  &\\\\\n0  &  \\frac{1}{2}  &  \\frac{1}{2}  &  10\\\\\n  &  &  &\\\\\n\\frac{1}{2}  &  \\frac{1}{2}  &  0  &  16\n\\end{array}\\right]\n\\stackrel{\\rightarrow}{3R1}\n\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc|c}\n1  &  1  &  1  &  36\\\\\n  &  &  &\\\\\n0  &  \\frac{1}{2}  &  \\frac{1}{2}  &  10\\\\\n  &  &  &\\\\\n\\frac{1}{2}  &  \\frac{1}{2}  &  0  &  16\n\\end{array}\\right]\\]\n\nWe let $R_i$ indicate an operation on row i. We now have to clear out\nthe rest of the entries in column 1 to be zero. We see that column one\non row two is already zero and so we can move on to row three. To remove\nthe entry in column 1 of row 3, we can subtract off 1/2 of row 1.\nTherefore\n\n\\[\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc|c}\n1  &  1  &  1  &  36\\\\\n  &  &  &\\\\\n0  &  \\frac{1}{2}  &  \\frac{1}{2}  &  10\\\\\n  &  &  &\\\\\n\\frac{1}{2}  &  \\frac{1}{2}  &  0  &  16\n\\end{array}\\right]\n\\stackrel{\\rightarrow}{R3-1/2R1}\n\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc|c}\n1  &  1  &  1  &  36\\\\\n  &  &  &\\\\\n0  &  \\frac{1}{2}  &  \\frac{1}{2}  &  10\\\\\n  &  &  &\\\\\n0  &  0  &  -1/2  &  -2\n\\end{array}\\right]\\]\n\nWe now move on to the second column and we seek to place a pivot in the\nsecond row. We want the pivot to have the value of 1 and so we multiply\nthe whole row by 2. Therefore\n\n\\[\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc|c}\n1  &  1  &  1  &  36\\\\\n  &  &  &\\\\\n0  &  \\frac{1}{2}  &  \\frac{1}{2}  &  10\\\\\n  &  &  &\\\\\n0  &  0  &  -1/2  &  -2\n\\end{array}\\right]\n\\stackrel{\\rightarrow}{2R2}\n\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc|c}\n1  &  1  &  1  &  36\\\\\n  &  &  &\\\\\n0  &  1  &  1  &  20\\\\\n  &  &  &\\\\\n0  &  0  &  -1/2  &  -2\n\\end{array}\\right]\\]\n\nTo make the entries above and below this new pivot zero we must subtract\nrow 2 from row 1 and we leave row three alone since it is already zero.\n\n\\[\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc|c}\n1  &  1  &  1  &  36\\\\\n  &  &  &\\\\\n0  &  1  &  1  &  20\\\\\n  &  &  &\\\\\n0  &  0  &  -1/2  &  -2\n\\end{array}\\right]\n\\stackrel{\\rightarrow}{R1-R2}\n\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc|c}\n1  &  0  &  0  &  16\\\\\n  &  &  &\\\\\n0  &  1  &  1  &  20\\\\\n  &  &  &\\\\\n0  &  0  &  -1/2  &  -2\n\\end{array}\\right]\\]\n\nFinally for the last pivot in the third row and third column we have to\nmultiply row three by -2. We will then have to subtract row three from\nrow two so that the third column entry in the second row vanishes. We do\nnot need to perform any operations on the first row since there is\nalready a zero in the third column.\n\n\\[\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc|c}\n1  &  0  &  0  &  16\\\\\n  &  &  &\\\\\n0  &  1  &  1  &  20\\\\\n  &  &  &\\\\\n0  &  0  &  -1/2  &  -2\n\\end{array}\\right]\n\\stackrel{\\rightarrow}{-2R3}\n\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc|c}\n1  &  0  &  0  &  16\\\\\n  &  &  &\\\\\n0  &  1  &  1  &  20\\\\\n  &  &  &\\\\\n0  &  0  &  1  &  4\n\\end{array}\\right]\n\\stackrel{\\rightarrow}{R2-R3}\n\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc|c}\n1  &  0  &  0  &  16\\\\\n  &  &  &\\\\\n0  &  1  &  0  &  16\\\\\n  &  &  &\\\\\n0  &  0  &  1  &  4\n\\end{array}\\right]\\]\n\nHaving all entries zero except for the pivots we have our matrix in\nreduced row-echelon form. The advantage to putting the matrix in this\nform is that we can immediately determine the vector \\textbf{x}. We have\nthat,\n\n\\begin{align*}\nx_1&=16\\\\\nx_2&=16\\\\\nx_3&=4\n\\end{align*}\n\nTherefore we conclude that the yield of the wheat is 16 tons/hectare for\ntype 1, 16 tons/hectare for type 2 and 4 tons/hectare for type 3. Notice\nthat if we were so inclined we could put our solution in for \\textbf{x}\nin the original problem an we do indeed recover the right output vector\n\\textbf{b}. If instead you opted to just put the matrix in row-echelon\nform, you would get\n\n\\[\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc|c}\n1  &  1  &  1  &  36\\\\\n  &  &  &\\\\\n0  &  1  &  1  &  20\\\\\n  &  &  &\\\\\n0  &  0  &  1  &  4\n\\end{array}\\right]\\]\n\nwhich of course leads to the same conclusion but some arithmetic is\ninvolved. This type of situation is often the trade off in deciding\nwhich process to choose. Doing a row-echelon form is often quicker but\nbecause it only guarantees entries \\textbf{below} pivots are zero, then\narithmetic will almost always be required to get the solution.\nConversely, the reduced row-echelon form takes longer to obtain but then\nthe unknowns are clearly presented."
