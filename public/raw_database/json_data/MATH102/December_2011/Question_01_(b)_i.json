        "To do this problem, we rearrange the equation to isolate $y$ and then\ntake the derivative of $y$ with respect to $x$:\n\n\\begin{align*}\ne^{2x} + y(1 - x) = 1 \\\\\n\\rightarrow \\quad y = \\frac{1 - e^{2x}}{1 - x}\n\\end{align*}\n\nUsing the quotient rule, we evaluate $dy/dx$ and we are done:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{dy}{dx} = \\frac{(-2e^{2x})(1-x) - (-1)(1 - e^{2x})}{(1-x)^{2}} = \\frac{-3e^{2x}+2xe^{2x}+1}{(x-1)^{2}}.\n\\end{align*}\n\nHence, at \\emph{x = 0} we obtain\n\n\\[\\frac{dy}{dx}(0) = \\frac{-3e^{0}+0+1}{(-1)^2} = -2\\]", 
        "We can also use implicit differentiation. By differentiating with\nrespect to \\emph{x} we obtain:\n\n\\[2e^{2x} + \\frac{dy}{dx}(1-x) + y(-1) = 0\\] (Watch out for the product\nrule on the term \\emph{y}(1-\\emph{x}))\n\nThe difference is that we need to know the value of \\emph{y} when\n\\emph{x} = 0, but if we plug that in the original equation we obtain\n\n\\[\\displaystyle\ne^0 + y(1-0) = 1\\] and so we have that \\emph{y} = 0. We use this in what\nwe obtained by differentiating implicitly:\n\n\\[2e^0 + \\frac{dy}{dx} + 0 = 0\\] and so we have that\n\n\\[\\frac{dy}{dx}(0) = -2\\]"

        "You can either use implicit differentiation or solve for \\emph{y}.\n\nGive it a try, we provide a solution for each method."
