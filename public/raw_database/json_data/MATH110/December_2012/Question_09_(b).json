        "We start with Fact 1 - we know that the claim is true for $n = 1$. Then,\nusing Fact 2, since the claim is true for $n = 1$, we can say that it is\nalso true for the next integer, $n = 2$. We can then use Fact 2 again;\nsince we just said the claim is true for $n = 2$, it is also true for\nthe next integer, $n = 3$. We can continue this process until we get to\n$n = 6$, which is the value of \\emph{n} shown in the statement of the\nquestion.\n\n(Note that you can prove the above statement is true simply by doing the\ncalculations - but this does not use the inductive reasoning steps\ndescribed in part a)."
