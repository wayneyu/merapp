    "statement": "A player begins a game of chance by placing a marker in box 2, marked\nstart. A die is rolled, and the marker is moved one square to the left\nif a 1 or 2 is rolled and one square to the right if a 3, 4, 5, or 6 is\nrolled. This process continues until the marker lands in square 1, in\nwhich case the player wins the game, or in square 4, in which case the\nplayer loses the game.\n\n\\textbf{(c)} Suppose you are told that the eigenvalues of the stochastic\nmatrix are $\\lambda_1 = 1$, $\\lambda_2 = 1$,\n$\\lambda_3 = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{3}$, $\\lambda_4 = -\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{3}$, and\nthe corresponding eigenvalues are\n$v_1 = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix}$,\n$v_2 = \\begin{bmatrix} 0\\\\ 0\\\\ 0\\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix}$, $v_3$, $v_4$, and\nthat the eigenvectors form a basis of $\\mathbb{R}^4$. Write down a\nmatrix equation that you would solve in order to find the unique set of\ncoe\u00ef\u00ac\u0083cients ${c_1, c_2, c_3, c_4}$ to express the initial state of the\ngame, $x_0 = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}^T$, in terms of\nthe above basis of eigenvectors. Just write the equation symbolically\nusing $v_i$, $c_i$, and $x_0$.",

        "This becomes an $A \\vec{x} = \\vec{b}$ problem. We want to solve for the\n$c_i$, so we start by using the vectors $v_i$ to build A, by writing\n$A = \\begin{bmatrix} v_1 & v_2 & v_3 & v_4 \\end{bmatrix}$, and\n$\\vec{b} = \\vec{x_0}$. So we can write\n$\\begin{bmatrix} v_1 & v_2 & v_3 & v_4 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} c_1 \\\\ c_2 \\\\ c_3 \\\\ c_4 \\end{bmatrix} = \\vec{x_0}$.\nSolving this for the $c_i$ would give us the set of coefficients to\nexpress the initial state of the game."
