        "To find the standard matrix of this linear transformation, we simply\nconsider the image of the three base vectors.\n\nThe vector {[}1, 0, 0{]} is sent to the vector {[}-1, 0, 0{]} and the\nvectors {[}0, 1, 0{]} and {[}0, 0, 1{]} simply remain where they are\n(since they belong to the \\emph{yz}-plane itself). Hence the standard\nmatrix of this linear transformation is\n\n\\begin{align*}\\left[ \\begin{array}{ccc}\n-1 & 0 & 0\\\\\n0 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 1\n\\end{array}\\right]\\end{align*}"
