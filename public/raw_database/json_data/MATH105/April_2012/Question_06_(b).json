        "We are maximizing $f(p,q) = pq$ subject to $g(p,q) = p^2 + 4q^2 = 800$.\nSolving the constraint for zero we obtain\n$h(p,q) = p^2 + 4q^2 - 800 = 0$, so that the Lagrange system is\n\n\\[\\nabla f(p,q) = \\lambda \\nabla h(p,q)\\]\n\nComputing the gradients,\n\n\\[f_p = (pq)_p = q \\qquad f_q = (pq)_q = p\\] Also,\n\n\\[h_p = (p^2 + 4q^2)_p = 2p \\qquad h_q = (p^2 + 4q^2)_q = 8q\\]\n\nTherefore,\n\n\\[\\displaystyle\n<q,p> = \\lambda <2p, 8q>\\] which gives us two equations, namely:\n\n\\begin{align*}\nq &= 2 \\lambda p \\quad \\text{(equation 1)} \\\\\np &= 8 \\lambda q \\quad \\text{(equation 2)}\n\\end{align*}\n\nIn substituting $q = 2 \\lambda p$ into $p = 8 \\lambda q$, we get\n\n\\[\\displaystyle\np = 8 \\lambda (2 \\lambda p) = 16 \\lambda^2 p\\]\n\nWe can factor this to find $p(1 - 16 \\lambda^2) = 0$ so that either\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\itemsep1pt\\parskip0pt\\parsep0pt\n\\item\n  $\\displaystyle p = 0$\n\\item\n  $\\displaystyle 1 - 16\\lambda^2 = 0$, i.e. $\\lambda = \\pm 1/4$.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\itemsep1pt\\parskip0pt\\parsep0pt\n\\item\n  If $p=0$ then $q = 2 \\lambda (0) = 0$, and $p=q=0$ cannot satisfy the\n  constraint. \\textbf{We reject this case.}\n\\item\n  If $\\lambda = \\pm 1/4$ then $q = 2 (\\pm 1/4) p = \\pm p/2$.\n  Substituting this into the constraint gives:\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\\[0 = p^2 + 4(\\pm p/2)^2 -800 = 2p^2-800\\] which mean\n\\emph{p}\\textsuperscript{2} = 400, or $p=\\pm20$.\n\nWe take the positive root (since price should be positive).

Or to look at it another way: if q =\n0 then from the equations that forces p=0 (and vice versa), and p=q=0\ncould not satisfy the constraint. If we divide the equations then\n$q/p = (2 \\lambda p)/(8 \\lambda q) = p/(4q)$. Cross-multiplying gives\nthe relation $p^2 = 4q^2$ which could be used in the constraint equation\nto find p and q.}"
