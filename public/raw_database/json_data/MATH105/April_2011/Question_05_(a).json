    "statement": "You open a savings account under the Escalator Plan with an initial\ndeposit of $\\$P$. The advantage of this plan is that the interest rate\nis not fixed, but grows proportionally with time as long as the account\nis alive. In other words, the money in the account collects interest at\nthe annual rate of $rt$ at time $t,$ compounded continuously (here $r$\nis a constant). You also keep adding money to the account in the form of\na continuous deposit of $\\$S(t)$ at time $t.$\n\nWrite down the initial value problem for the amount $A(t)$ in your\naccount in time $t.$",

        "Let $P$ be the initial deposit in the account and $A(t)$ be the amount\nof money in the account at time $t$. We denote the interest rate by $i$.\nThe fact that we compound interest rate continuously translates into the\ndifferential equation\n\n\\begin{align*}\\frac{dA}{dt} = i \\cdot A\\end{align*}\n\nIn addition, at every time we add the amount $S(t)$ to the account.\nHence, the differential equation changes to\n\n\\begin{align*}\\frac{dA}{dt} = i \\cdot A + S\\end{align*}\n\nFurthermore, the interest rate grows proportionally with time. This\nmeans that $i = rt$ for some constant $r$. Thus, we arrive at\n\n\\begin{align*}\\frac{dA}{dt} = rt\\cdot A + S\\end{align*}\n\nWe also know that $A(0) = P$ because $P$ is the initial deposit."
