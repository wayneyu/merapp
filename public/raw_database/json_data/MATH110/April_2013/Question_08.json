    "statement": "In mechanics, a force exerted on a steel rod is called \\emph{stress},\nand denoted by \\emph{\u03c3}. The deformation of the rod due to this stress\nis called \\emph{strain}, and denoted \\emph{\u03b5}. Stress and strain are\nrelated by the\n\\href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramberg\\%E2\\%80\\%93Osgood_relationship}{Ramberg-Osgood\nequation}\n\n\\[\\displaystyle\n\\epsilon = a \\sigma + b\\sigma^n\\]\n\nwhere \\emph{a}, \\emph{b} and \\emph{n} are constants.\n\nSuppose the stress applied to a steel rod increases at a constant rate\nof \\emph{R}. Determine the rate at which the strain is increasing when\nthe stress is equal to \\emph{\u03c3\\textsubscript{0}}.\n\n\\emph{Hint: your answer will be an expression involving several\nconstants.}",

        "The question is asking us for the rate at which strain is increasing.\nSince strain is indicated by the variable $\\epsilon$, this means we are\nseeking $\\frac{d\\epsilon}{dt}$.\n\nTo find $\\frac{d\\epsilon}{dt}$ we differentiate the given formula with\nrespect to \\emph{t}. Remember that \\emph{a}, \\emph{b} and \\emph{n} are\nconstants, while $\\epsilon$ and $\\sigma$ are variables that depend on\n\\emph{t}. So $\\displaystyle \\epsilon(t) = a \\sigma(t) + b(\\sigma(t))^n$\nbecomes\n\n\\[\\frac{d\\epsilon}{dt}(t) = a \\frac{d\\sigma}{dt}(t) + bn (\\sigma(t))^{n-1}\\frac{d\\sigma}{dt}(t)\\]\n\nWe were asked to find $\\frac{d\\epsilon}{dt}$ where\n$\\sigma(t) = \\sigma_0$, so we can plug that value into the expression\nabove. Finally, recall we are also told earlier in the problem that the\nstress is increasing at a constant rate \\emph{R}. In the expression\nabove, the rate of stress increasing is given by\n$\\frac{d\\sigma}{dt}(t)$, so we replace $\\frac{d\\sigma}{dt}(t)$ with\n\\emph{R}. This gives our final answer of:\n\n\\[\\frac{d\\epsilon}{dt} = a R + bn \\sigma_0^{n-1}R\\]"
