        "We compute the equation of the line between the points $(-2,3)$ and\n$(0,5)$. First compute the slope via\n\n$m = \\frac{5-3}{0-(-2)} = \\frac{2}{2} = 1.$\n\nThe \\emph{y}-intercept is given to be 5 since the point $(0,5)$ is on\nthe line. Thus the equation of the line is $y = x + 5$. As this line is\ntangent to the function at 1, we see that $\\displaystyle m=1=f'(1)$ and\n$f(1) = y = (1)+5 = 6$ completing the question.", 
        "According to the point slope formula given by\n\n$y - y_{0} = m(x - x_{0})$\n\nwe can use the fact that our tangent line in question contains the point\n$(1,f(1))$ and has slope $\\displaystyle f'(1)$ and thus, we have the\nequation of the line is given by\n\n$\\displaystyle y - f(1) = f'(1)(x - 1)$\n\nNow, we know that the points $(-2,3)$ and $(0,5)$ lie on our cruve and\nthis gives the two equations\n\n\\begin{align*}\n5 - f(1) &= f'(1)(0 - 1)\\\\\n3 - f(1) &= f'(1)(-2 - 1)\\end{align*}\n\nSimplifying gives\n\n\\begin{align*}\n5 - f(1) &= -f'(1)\\\\\n3 - f(1) &= -3f'(1)\\end{align*}\n\nSubtracting yields\n\n\\begin{align*}\n2 &= 2f'(1)\\end{align*}\n\nand so $\\displaystyle f'(1) = 1$. Plugging back into either of the\noriginal equations yields $f(1) = 6$"
