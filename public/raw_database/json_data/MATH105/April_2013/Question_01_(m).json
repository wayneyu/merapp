        "Remember that the cumulative distribution function, $F(x)$, is defined\nin terms of the probability density function, $f(x)$, as follows:\n\n\\[F(t) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{t}f(x)\\,dx.\\] Hence, to determine the\ncumulative distribution function for the given probability density\nfunction is a matter of plugging the particular density function into\nthe definition. (Remember that since the given density function is only\ndefined for $x \\ge 1$, we can assume that the density function evaluates\nto 0 for all $\\displaystyle x < 1$):\n\n\\[F(t) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{t}f(x)\\,dx = \\int_{1}^{t}3x^{-4}\\,dx = -x^{-3}|_{1}^{t} = 1 - t^{-3}.\\]\nTherefore, the cumulative distribution is\n${\\color{blue}F(t) = 1 - \\frac{1}{t^3}}$"
