        "We know that $Av=\\lambda v$, thus\n$A(Bv)=ABv=BAv=B(Av)=B(\\lambda v)=\\lambda (Bv)$.\n\nThis shows that $Bv$ is the eigenvector of A with the eigenvalue\n$\\lambda$, such that $A(Bv)=\\lambda (Bv)$.\n\nSince B is invertible and v is not the zero vector, we know that $Bv$ is\nnot a zero vector. We can conclude that Bv is an eigenvector of A with\nthe same eigenvalue."
