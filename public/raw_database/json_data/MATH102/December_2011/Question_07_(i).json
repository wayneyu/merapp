        "The question is asking us to find the rate of change of the variable x.\n(i.e: We want to solve for dx/dt). Using implicit differentiation and\nthe equation $y = x^{2}$ we will derive a value for these quantities as\nfollows:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{d}{dt}y &= \\frac{d}{dt}x^{2} \\\\\n\\frac{dy}{dt} &= 2x\\frac{dx}{dt} \\quad \\rightarrow \\quad \\frac{dx}{dt} = \\frac{1}{2x}\\frac{dy}{dt}\\end{align*} From the information about the rate of change of y at the\npoint P, we make the appropriate substitutions in the equation to\ndetermine dx/dt:\n\n\\begin{align*}\\frac{dx}{dt} = \\frac{1}{2(2)}8 = 2 \\quad \\rightarrow \\quad {\\color{blue}\\frac{dx}{dt} =2}\\end{align*}"
