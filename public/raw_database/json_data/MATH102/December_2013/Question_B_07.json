    "statement": "Initially, a patient has $1000$ copies of the HIV virus. If the smallest\ndetectable viral load is $350,000$ virus particles, how long (in days)\nwill it take until the HIV infection is detectable? Assume that the\nnumber of virus particles \\emph{y} grows according to the equation\n\n$\\frac{dy}{dt} = 0.05y$\n\nwhere \\emph{t} is time in days. Leave your answer in terms of\nlogarithms.",
