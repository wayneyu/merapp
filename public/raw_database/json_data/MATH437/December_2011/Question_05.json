        "The claim is clearly true of one of \\emph{m} or \\emph{n} equals 1. Thus\nwe suppose that both are strictly greater than 1.\n\nIn this case, the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic tells us that we may\nwrite\n\n\\[\\displaystyle m = \\prod_{i=1}^{k}p_{i}^{\\alpha_{i}}\\]\n\nand\n\n\\[\\displaystyle n = \\prod_{j=1}^{\\ell}q_{j}^{\\beta_{j}}\\]\n\nwhere each of the exponents is a positive integer at least 1. The left\nhand side of the equation in question thus reduces to\n\n\\[\\displaystyle m\\phi(m) = \\prod_{i=1}^{k}p_{i}^{\\alpha_{i}}\\left(\\prod_{i=1}^{k}p_{i}^{\\alpha_{i}-1}(p_{i}-1)\\right) = \\prod_{i=1}^{k}p_{i}^{2\\alpha_{i}-1}(p_{i}-1)\\]\n\nand in total as we are given that $\\displaystyle m\\phi(m) = n\\phi(n)$,\nwe have\n\n\\[\\displaystyle \\prod_{i=1}^{k}p_{i}^{2\\alpha_{i}-1}(p_{i}-1) = \\prod_{j=1}^{\\ell}q_{j}^{2\\beta_{j}-1}(q_{j}-1)\\]\n\nNow, suppose that \\emph{m} and \\emph{n} are distinct. Let\n$\\displaystyle p_{0}$ be the largest prime where they differ and without\nloss of generality, suppose that\n$\\displaystyle p_{0}^{\\alpha_{0}} \\parallel m$ but\n$\\displaystyle p_{0}^{\\alpha_{0}} \\nmid n$. Then we know that we must\nhave that $\\displaystyle p_{0} \\mid (q_{j_{0}}-1)$ for some\n$\\displaystyle j_{0}$. Thus $\\displaystyle q_{j_{0}} > p_{0}$.\n\nHowever, $\\displaystyle p_{0}$ was chosen to be the largest such prime\nwhere \\emph{m} and \\emph{n} differ to any power. So\n$\\displaystyle q_{j_{0}}^{\\beta_{j_{0}}} = p_{i_{0}}^{\\alpha_{i_{0}}}$\nfor some $\\displaystyle i_{0}$ and thus\n$\\displaystyle (q_{j_{0}}-1) = (p_{i_{0}}-1)$. Thus, we may cancel out\nthese terms and repeat this argument to find another index\n$\\displaystyle j_{0}$ and since there are only finitely many of these\nterms, we must eventually reach a contradiction.\n\nHence \\emph{m} and \\emph{n} have all the same prime factors to the same\npowers and thus are equal.\n\n\\textbf{Food for thought}: Is there an easier proof of this using the\nfact that\n\n$\\displaystyle n\\phi(n) =2 \\sum k$\n\nwhere the above sum ranges over all integers\n$\\displaystyle 1 \\leq k \\leq n$ with $\\displaystyle \\gcd(k,n) = 1$?"
