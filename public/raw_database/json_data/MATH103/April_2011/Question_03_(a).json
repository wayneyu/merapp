        "We will preface this question by noting that the original intent in the\nexam was to understand the sketch well enough to proceed to\n\\href{Science:Math_Exam_Resources/Courses/MATH103/April_2011/Question_3_(b)}{part\n(b)}. However, we have decided to present the solution as detailed as\npossible for those who would like to improve their curve sketching\ntechniques.\n\nNow we will complete this question by following a checklist that is\nfairly standard for these types of problems.\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\itemsep1pt\\parskip0pt\\parsep0pt\n\\item\n  Find roots\n\\item\n  Determine any asymptotes\n\\item\n  Determine critical points\n\\item\n  Determine intervals of increase and decrease and local max/min\n\\item\n  Determine intervals of concavity and points of inflection\n\\item\n  Sketch the graph\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\\textbf{1: Find roots:}\n\nLuckily we have a polynomial that is already written in factored form so\nwe can read, as the roots, the factors. Therefore if\n\n\\[\\displaystyle{}f(x)=x(x-2)(x+1)=0\\]\n\nthen the roots are at $x=0$, $x=2$, $x=-1$.\n\n\\textbf{2: Asymptotes:}\n\nNow polynomials are continuous everywhere (their domain is all the real\nnumbers) and so we do not expect any vertical asymptotes. When looking\nfor horizontal asymptotes we typically take the limit as $x$ goes to\n$\\infty$. We don't need to be so formal here because it's clear that as\n$x$ gets large then $f(x)$ also gets large as their is nothing (such as\na denominator) to slow its growth. What's to be determined is whether\n$f(x)$ gets large and positive or large and negative. If we were to put\na very large positive value of $x$ into $f(x)$ we would get that\n\n\\[f(x)=x(x-2)(x+1)\\approx{}x^3\\]\n\nsince adding or subtracting numbers to something large is unaffected.\nNow as $x$ goes to $\\infty$ then $f(x)$ will go to $\\infty$ as well. If\nwe put in a large negative number, once again adding or subtracting\nsmall numbers will have no affect and once again,\n\n\\[f(x)\\approx{}x^3\\]\n\nwhich approaches $-\\infty$ as $x$ goes to $-\\infty$. Therefore,\n\n\\begin{align*}\n\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}f(x)&=+\\infty\\\\\n\\lim_{x\\to{-\\infty}}f(x)&=-\\infty.\n\\end{align*}\n\n\\textbf{3. Critical Points:}\n\nIn order to find critical points we first need the derivative. In order\nto do this we need to apply the product rule three times. Therefore,\n\n\\[\\displaystyle{}f'(x)=(x-2)(x+1)+x(x+1)+x(x-2)=3x^2-2x-2.\\]\n\nCritical points will occur when $f'(x)=0$. Therefore,\n\n\\begin{align*}\n3x^2-2x-2&=0\\\\\nx=\\frac{2\\pm\\sqrt{4+24}}{6}&=\\frac{1}{3}\\pm\\frac{\\sqrt{7}}{{3}}\n\\end{align*}\n\nare our critical points.\n\n\\textbf{4. Intervals of Increase and Decrease and Local Max/Min:}\n\nWe have that our derivative is,\n\n\\[\\displaystyle{}f'(x)=3x^2-2x-2\\]\n\nwith critical points\n\n\\[x=\\frac{1}{3}\\pm\\frac{\\sqrt{7}}{{3}}.\\]\n\nTo find intervals of increasing and decreasing we look at the derivative\nbetween each critical point over the entire domain. If the derivative is\npositive then the function is increasing and if the derivative is\nnegative, the function is decreasing.\n\n\\begin{longtable}[c]{@{}llll@{}}\n& $\\left(-\\infty,\\frac{1}{3}-\\frac{\\sqrt{7}}{{3}}\\right)$ &\n$\\left(\\frac{1}{3}-\\frac{\\sqrt{7}}{{3}},\\frac{1}{3}+\\frac{\\sqrt{7}}{{3}}\\right)$\n& $\\left(\\frac{1}{3}+\\frac{\\sqrt{7}}{{3}},\\infty\\right)$\\\\\n\n$\\displaystyle {}f'(x)$ & Positive & Negative & Positive\\\\\n$\\displaystyle {}f(x)$ & Increasing & Decreasing & Increasing\\\\\n\\end{longtable}\n\nFrom the table we see that the critical point\n\n\\[\\frac{1}{3}-\\frac{\\sqrt{7}}{{3}}\\]\n\nis a local maximum since the derivative is increasing on the left and\ndecreasing on the right. By a similar logic we have that the other\ncritical point\n\n\\[\\frac{1}{3}+\\frac{\\sqrt{7}}{{3}}\\]\n\nis a local minimum.\n\n\\textbf{5. Intervals of Concavity and Points of Inflection:}\n\nIn order to determine points of inflection we have to compute the second\nderivative. Since the first derivative is just a polynomial we can\neasily compute term by term with the power rule to get\n\n\\[\\displaystyle{}f''(x)=6x-2.\\]\n\nPossible points of inflection occur when $f''(x)=0$, i.e. there is a\npossible point of inflection as $x=1/3$. In order for it to be a point\nof inflection we require that the second derivative change sign as we\ncross $x=1/3$. If the second derivative is positive, the graph is\nconcave up; if it is negative, the graph is concave down.\n\n\\begin{longtable}[c]{@{}lll@{}}\n& $\\left(-\\infty,\\frac{1}{3}\\right)$ & $\\left(\\frac{1}{3},\\infty\\right)$\\\\\n\n$\\displaystyle {}f''(x)$ & Negative & Positive\\\\\n$\\displaystyle {}f(x)$ & Concave Down & Concave Up\\\\\n\\end{longtable}\n\nNotice that the change in concavity, confirms that we do indeed have an\ninflection point at $x=1/3$.\n\n\\textbf{6. Sketch:}\n\nThe picture to the right \\includegraphics[width=.5\\textwidth]{Math103Apr20113a.png} shows a\nsketch of the graph. We have labelled intervals of increasing with red\nand decreasing with blue. Concave up is a thin solid line while concave\ndown is a thick dashed line. We have placed x's to mark the roots,\nfilled in circles to mark the local maximum and minimum, and triangles\nto indicate the point of inflection."
