        "\\emph{There is a certain ambiguity to how the diagram presents this\nproblem. While it talks of a standard swimming pool with an inclined\nplane along the bottom, the diagram looks as if the top-side is\ninclined. Therefore we will present a solution where the bottom is flat\nand the top side is inclined and another solution where the top is flat\nand the bottom side is inclined. The approach to both problems is the\nsame but the numerical results will differ.}\n\n\\textbf{Top Flat, Bottom Inclined:}\n\nCreate a diagram (like that to the right) that just illustrates the side\nof pool we are interested in\n{right\\textbar{}500px\\textbar{}thumbnail}.\nWe will use the standard coordinate system of $x$ representing the\nhorizontal direction and $y$ representing the vertical direction.\n\nNotice we can divide the figure into a rectangular portion and a\ntriangular portion which in the diagram is separated by a dashed line.\nNow we are interested in determining the hydrostatic force that is\nexerted on this pool wall. From the hint we know this depends on the\npressure which we can write as,\n\n\\begin{align*}\n\\displaystyle{}P=\\rho{}g(2-y)\n\\end{align*}\n\nwhere we take $y=0$ to be the bottom of the diagram. Because of this\nchoice for y, we have that the depth, h, as defined in the hint is\nactually h=2-y which is why that shows up in the hydrostatic pressure.\nWe see that depending where we are along the pool side, we will exert a\ndifferent pressure and therefore a different force. Since the pressure\ndepends on the height, $y$, let's consider a very small rectangle of\nheight $\\textrm{d}y$ and length, $L$. The small amount of force exerted\non this rectangle of area $\\textrm{d}A$ is,\n\n\\begin{align*}\n\\displaystyle{}\\textrm{d}F=P\\textrm{d}A=\\rho{}g(2-y)Ldy.\n\\end{align*}\n\nTherefore the total amount of force exerted will be the sum of the\nlittle amounts of force on each rectangle as we go from height $y=0$ to\nheight $y=2$. However, we have to be careful, because as we climb up the\nheight of the pool side, the length of the small rectangles depend on\nour height $y$ due to the pool getting narrower in the triangular\nregion. We will then break up the problem into computing the total force\non the rectangular portion, $F_1$ and the total force on the triangular\nportion, $F_2$. In the end the total force will be, $F=F_1+F_2$.\n\n\\textbf{Rectangular Portion}:\n\nIn this region, for any given height, $y$, the length is a constant and\nin fact it is the length of the pool,\n\n\\begin{align*}\nL=20.\n\\end{align*}\n\nTherefore, for this region we have that for every little rectangle,\n\n\\begin{align*}\n\\displaystyle\\textrm{d}F_1=\\rho{g}20(2-y)\\textrm{d}y.\n\\end{align*}\n\nIn order to add up the contributions from all the small rectangles we\nturn to integration,\n\n\\begin{align*}\nF_1=\\int\\textrm{d}F_1&=\\int_1^2\\rho{g}20(2-y)\\textrm{d}y\\\\\n&=\\rho{g}20\\left.\\left(2y-\\frac{y^2}{2}\\right)\\right|_{1}^2\\\\\n&=\\frac{\\rho{g}20}{2}=10\\rho{g}.\n\\end{align*}\n\nThe limits of integration can be seen from the diagram since the\nrectangular region starts at $y=1$ and goes to the top of the pool at\n$y=2$.\n\n\\textbf{Triangular Portion}:\n\nThis region is slightly more tricky to compute because the length\nchanges with the height. The first thing we need to do is figure out a\nfunction for the slanted side of the triangle in terms of $x$ and $y$.\nWe see that it is a line so it will be of the form $y=mx+b$ with $m$ the\nslope and $b$ the y-intercept. We know that when the height is 1, we are\nat the left edge of the diagram which we will denote $x=0$. When the\nheight is 0, we are at the right edge of the diagram which we know is\n$x=20$.\n\nTherefore we get that the slope is\n\n\\begin{align*}\nm=\\frac{0-1}{20-0}=-\\frac{1}{20}\n\\end{align*}\n\nand the y-intercept occurs when $x=0$ so $b=1$. Therefore, the slanted\nedge of the triangle is given by,\n\n\\begin{align*}\ny=-\\frac{1}{20}x+1.\n\\end{align*}\n\nNow at any height, the length of our small rectangle will start at the\nslant edge,\n\n\\begin{align*}\n\\displaystyle{}x=-20(y-1)\n\\end{align*}\n\nand extend to the right edge of the diagram at $x=20$. Therefore we have\nthat the length at any given height $y$, is\n\n\\begin{align*}\n\\displaystyle{}L(y)=20-(-20(y-1))=20y.\n\\end{align*}\n\nThe small amount of force on any rectangle in this region is,\n\n\\begin{align*}\n\\displaystyle{}\\textrm{d}F_2=P\\textrm{d}A=\\rho{g}(2-y)L\\textrm{d}y=\\rho{g}20(2-y)y\\textrm{d}y.\n\\end{align*}\n\nIn order to get the total force on the triangular region we integrate\nall these little $\\textrm{d}F_2$ over every height in the triangular\nregion. This region starts at $y=0$ and ends at $y=1$. Therefore these\nare our lower and upper limits of integration respectively. We get for\nour total force in this region,\n\n\\begin{align*}\nF_2=\\int\\textrm{d}F_2&=\\int_0^1\\rho{g}20(2y-y^2)\\textrm{d}y\\\\\n&=\\rho{g}20\\left.\\left(y^2-\\frac{y^3}{3}\\right)\\right|_{0}^1\\\\\n&=\\frac{40}{3}\\rho{g}.\n\\end{align*}\n\nWe can now compute the total force as,\n\n\\begin{align*}\nF=F_1+F_2=\\rho{g}\\left(10+\\frac{40}{3}\\right)=\\frac{70}{3}\\rho{g}\n\\end{align*}\n\nwhich using the numbers provided in the question, $\\rho=1000$ and\n$g=9.8$, we get,\n\n\\begin{align*}\nF\\approx{}228666.7N\n\\end{align*}\n\nwhich is a very large force but not unsurprising considering the power\nthat water has.\n\n\\textbf{Caution!!}\n\nYou may be tempted to want to set up an integral with $x$ instead of\n$y$, i.e. a diagram that looks like that to the right\n{right\\textbar{}500px\\textbar{}thumbnail}.\n\nThe problem is that, as we mentioned above, the pressure is a function\nof height.
