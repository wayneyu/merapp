        "A picture is included below. To solve this question, we need to use the\nmethod of left and right side integration. Recall the formula\n\n\\begin{align*}V = \\pi \\int_{a}^{b}((x_{R}+s)^{2} - (x_{L}+s)^{2})\\, dy\\end{align*}\n\nwhere we think of $x_{R}$ and $x_{L}$ as functions of \\emph{y} and the\n$s$ factor is the shifting factor (so basically this factor accounts for\nwhat line we are rotating over - the picture should make this clear).\nHere, the right most curve is $x_{R} = \\arccos(y)$ and the left most\ncurve is $x_{L} = 0$ and the $s$ factor in this case is \\emph{2}. The\nlast thing is the limits of integration. we know on the \\emph{x}-axis,\nfrom the previous problem, we were integrating from 0 to\n$\\tfrac{\\pi}{2}$. Here however we are integrating from the \\emph{y}-axis\nso we want to know when $\\cos(x)$ crosses the \\emph{y}-axis. This occurs\nwhen $y=1$. Thus, we have\n\n\\begin{align*}V = \\pi\\int_{0}^{1} ((\\arccos(y)+2)^{2}-(2)^{2})\\, dy = \\pi\\int_{0}^{1}((\\arccos(y))^{2} + 4\\arccos(y))\\, dy\\end{align*}\n\nTo challenge yourself, try showing the above is actually equal to\n$\\displaystyle \\pi^2+2\\pi$.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htbp]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=.5\\textwidth]{MATH101Apr2009Q3b.jpeg}\n\\caption{MATH101Apr2009Q3b.jpeg}\n\\end{figure}"
