        "As suggested in the hint, we start by drawing the vertical and\nhorizontal asymptotes. The vertical asymptotes are $x = 1$, $x = -1$ and\nthe horizontal asymptote is $y = 2$.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htbp]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=.5\\textwidth]{ScienceMathExamResourcesCoursesMATH110April2012Question5ga.jpg}\n\\caption{ScienceMathExamResourcesCoursesMATH110April2012Question5ga.jpg}\n\\end{figure}\n\nWe know that the function increases to the left of $x = -1$, increases\nagain between -1 and 0, and then decreases from 0 to 1, and then again\nafter $x = 1$. Furthermore, the graph must go through the x-axis at the\npoint (0,0) but not anywhere else. This suggests the following picture:\n\n\\begin{figure}[htbp]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=.5\\textwidth]{ScienceMathExamResourcesCoursesMATH110April2012Question5gc.jpg}\n\\caption{ScienceMathExamResourcesCoursesMATH110April2012Question5gc.jpg}\n\\end{figure}\n\nConfirming that this picture matches the concavity found in part\n\\emph{$f$} (concave up outside of (-1,1), concave up inside (-1,1)), we we\narrive at the final sketch:\n\n\\begin{figure}[htbp]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=.5\\textwidth]{ScienceMathExamResourcesCoursesMATH110April2012Question5gd.jpg}\n\\caption{ScienceMathExamResourcesCoursesMATH110April2012Question5gd.jpg}\n\\end{figure}"

        "By now you should have several pieces of information about the function:\nintercepts, asymptotes, etc. Try drawing the asymptotes, then determine\nwhere the function is increasing and decreasing. Use information about\nthe intercepts and concavity to finish the graph."
