        "As was suggested in the hint, one way to approach this problem is to\ndraw a function that satisfies the first criterion and then modify it to\nfit each following criterion. It is worth noting that there are many,\nmany ways to draw a picture satisfying all 4 criteria - the solution\nthat follows is just one example.\n\nOur first criterion is that the function be defined on the interval\n{[}-1,1{]}. We will draw just a straight line at $y = 1$ on this\ninterval:\n\n\\begin{figure}[htbp]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=.5\\textwidth]{ScienceMathExamResourcesCoursesMATH110April2012Question4pt1.jpg}\n\\caption{ScienceMathExamResourcesCoursesMATH110April2012Question4pt1.jpg}\n\\end{figure}\n\nNow we add the criterion that the function be discontinuous at $x = 0$\nand $x = 1$. One simple way to do this (without making the function\nundefined at those points, remember part 1!) is to move the two points\nat $x = 0$ and $x = 1$ to a new location, in our case, the x-axis.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htbp]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=.5\\textwidth]{ScienceMathExamResourcesCoursesMATH110April2012Question4pt2.jpg}\n\\caption{ScienceMathExamResourcesCoursesMATH110April2012Question4pt2.jpg}\n\\end{figure}\n\nNow we want $f$ to have a global minimum at $x = 0$. This is easy enough\n- we'll just move our point that's now at the origin down until it is\nthe lowest point on the entire graph.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htbp]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=.5\\textwidth]{ScienceMathExamResourcesCoursesMATH110April2012Question4pt3.jpg}\n\\caption{ScienceMathExamResourcesCoursesMATH110April2012Question4pt3.jpg}\n\\end{figure}\n\nFinally, we can't have a local or global maximum. Right now, our\nstraight line is both a local and global maximum because each point on\nthe line is greater than or equal to its neighboring points. In order to\nmake sure that each point on our line has a neighbor that is greater\nthan itself, we will tilt the line, like so:\n\n\\begin{figure}[htbp]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=.5\\textwidth]{ScienceMathExamResourcesCoursesMATH110April2012Question4pt4.jpg}\n\\caption{ScienceMathExamResourcesCoursesMATH110April2012Question4pt4.jpg}\n\\end{figure}\n\nThere are two important things to note here: first, this change has not\naltered any of the previous criteria (still defined on {[}-1,1{]}, still\ndiscontinuous at appropriate points, etc.) Second, look at the right\nendpoint of the graph. Because this point is undefined, $f$ cannot have\na global or local maximum at this point, and any point on the line\ncannot be a maximum either.\n\nThus we have drawn a function that satisfies all four criteria. We now\nsimply translate our picture into a piecewise function. The ``line''\nwill be two pieces, and each point at $x = 0$ and $x = 1$ will be\nanother piece each.\n\n$f(x) = \\begin{cases}\n1/2x + 1/2 & -1 \\leq x < 0 \\\\\n-1/2 & x = 0 \\\\\n1/2x + 1/2 & 0 < x < 1 \\\\\n0 & x = 1 \\\\\n\\end{cases}$"
