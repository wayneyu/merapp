        "To evaluate the slope of the curve at $x = 0$, we let\n\n\\[\\displaystyle\nf(x) = \\int_{0}^{2\\sin(x)}e^{-t^{2}}\\,dt\\] and evaluate $f'(0)$. By the\nfundamental theorem of calculus, we know that\n\n\\[\\displaystyle\nf(x) = \\int_{0}^{2\\sin(x)}e^{-t^{2}}\\,dt = F(2\\sin(x)) - F(0)\\]\n\nwhere $F$ is the antiderivative of the integrand\n(i.e\\[F'(t) = e^{-t^{2}}\\]). Taking the derivative with respect to $x$,\nwe find\n\n\\begin{align*}\nf'(x) &= \\frac{d}{dx}\\left[F(2\\sin(x)) - F(0) \\right] \\\\ &= F'(2\\sin(x))\\cdot\\frac{d}{dx}(2\\sin(x)) \\\\\n&= e^{-4\\sin^{2}(x)}\\cdot2\\cos(x) \\\\\nf'(0) &= 2\n\\end{align*} So the slope of the curve $y = f(x)$ at $x = 0$ is 2."
