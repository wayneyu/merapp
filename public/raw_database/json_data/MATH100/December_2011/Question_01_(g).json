        "The two variables that are changing in this problem are the volume of\nwater and the height of the water. These two variables are related in\nthe formula for volume of a cylinder:\n\n\\begin{align*}V = \\pi r^2 h\\end{align*} For this problem, we know that the radius of the\ncylinder is 3, so we can put that into our formula to get:\n\n\\begin{align*}V = 9\\pi  h\\end{align*} Since the question is asking about rates of change, we\nwill differentiate the above formula with respect to \\emph{t}.\n\n\\begin{align*}\\frac{dV}{dt} = 9\\pi\\frac{dh}{dt}\\end{align*} In this new formula, \\emph{dh/dt}\nstands for the rate at which the height of the water is changing, which\nis what we're solving for. We also know that \\emph{dV/dt} stands for the\nrate at which the volume of water is changing, which is \\emph{5\nm\\textsuperscript{3}/min}. So substituting in \\emph{dV/dt = 5} we have:\n\n\\begin{align*}5 = 9\\pi\\frac{dh}{dt}\\end{align*} And solving for \\emph{dh/dt} we get:\n\n\\begin{align*}\\frac{dh}{dt} = \\frac{5}{9\\pi} m/min\\end{align*}"
