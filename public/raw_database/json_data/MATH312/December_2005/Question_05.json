        "The correct answer is \\textbf{c = 37}.\n\nFollowing the hints, we seek to count the number of factors of 10 in the\nnumber $\\displaystyle 153!$. To do this we count the number of 5s\noccuring in its expansion. The number of 5s occurring in the expansion\nof $\\displaystyle n!$ is given by\n\n$\\displaystyle \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{5} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{5^{2}} \\right\\rfloor + ... + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{5^{\\lfloor \\log_{5}(n) \\rfloor}} \\right\\rfloor$\n\nThis is true since you get a factor of 5 every 5 integers. You get\nanother factor of 5 every 25 integers and so on. Counting this, we see\nthat\n\n$\\displaystyle \\left\\lfloor \\frac{153}{5} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{153}{5^{2}} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{153}{5^{3}} \\right\\rfloor = 30 + 6 + 1 = 37$."
