        "The following proof can be generalized very easily to an \\emph{n} by\n\\emph{n} matrix and so we present this solution first. Let\n\n$\\displaystyle J = \\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1\n\\end{bmatrix}$and let $\\displaystyle I$ be the five by five identity matrix. Then\n\n$\\displaystyle A = J-I$. Next, let\\[\\displaystyle e_{i} =  \\begin{bmatrix}\n0 \\\\\n0 \\\\\n\\vdots\\\\\n0 \\\\\n1 \\\\\n0 \\\\\n\\vdots\\\\\n0\n\\end{bmatrix}\\]\n\nbe the standard basis vectors where the 1 above is in the ith position.\nNotice then that the vectors $\\displaystyle e_{1,i}$ defined by\\[\\displaystyle e_{1,i}=e_{1}-e_{i}\\]\n\nfor \\emph{i} from 2 to 5 (or in general, the size of the matrix\n\\emph{J}). A simple calculation shows us that\n\n\\[\\displaystyle Je_{1,i} = 0\\]\n\nfor each value of i from 2 to 5. Further, taking the vector\n$\\displaystyle v = e_{1} + e_{2} + e_{3} + e_{4} + e_{5}$ (the all ones\nvector), we see that\\[\\displaystyle Jv = 5v.\\]\n\nAs every vector is an eigenvector of the identity matrix, we have\n\n\\[\\displaystyle Ae_{1,i} = (J-I)e_{1,i} = Je_{1,i} - e_{1,i} = -e_{1,i}\\]\n\nfor each \\emph{i} from 2 to 5 and\n\n\\[\\displaystyle Av = (J-I)v = Jv - v = 5v-v = (5-1)v = 4v\\]\n\nHence, we get $\\displaystyle (5-1)$ eigenvalues of $\\displaystyle (-1)$\nand one eigenvalue of $\\displaystyle (5-1)$. Thus, we have\n\n\\[\\displaystyle \\text{det}(A) = (-1)^{5-1}(5-1) = 4\\]\n\nTo generalize the above, just change every 5 above to an \\emph{n}.", 
        "Use the following determinant rules: The determinant of upper triangular\nmatrix (i.e a matrix in row echelon form in this case) is equal to the\nproduct of its diagonal entries. If i$\\neq$j , then subtracting some\nconstant time row i from row j does not change the determinant.Although there are multiple ways of finding determinants, this solution\nwill use rule 2 when performing row operations so that the determinant\nof the original matrix is the same as the matrix in row echelon form and\nthen use rule 1 to find the determinant.\n\nLet $A = \\begin{bmatrix} \n0& 1& 1& 1& 1\\\\ \n1& 0& 1& 1& 1\\\\ \n1& 1& 0& 1& 1\\\\ \n1& 1& 1& 0& 1\\\\ \n1& 1& 1& 1& 0\n\\end{bmatrix}$Step 1: Do the following row operations on the matrix A in the following\norder:\n\nrow 1 = row 1 + row 2\n\nrow 2 = row 2 - row 1\n\nrow 3 = row 3 - row 1\n\nand we get\n\n$\\begin{bmatrix} \n1& 1& 2& 2& 2\\\\ \n0& -1& -1& -1& -1\\\\ \n0& 0& -2& -1& -1\\\\ \n0& 0& -1& -2& -1\\\\ \n0& 0& -1& -1& -2\n\\end{bmatrix}$The matrix is still not in upper triangular form. Then perform the\nfollowing row operations:\n\nrow 4 = row 4 - $\\frac{1}{2}$row 3row 5 = row 5 - $\\frac{1}{2}$row 3and we get :\n\n$\\begin{bmatrix} \n1& 1& 2& 2& 2\\\\ \n0& -1& -1& -1& -1\\\\ \n0& 0& -2& -1& -1\\\\ \n0& 0& 0& -3/2& -1/2\\\\ \n0& 0& 0& -1/2& -3/2\n\\end{bmatrix}$After doing one more row operation, row 5 = row 5 - $\\frac{1}{3}$row 4 ,\nwe get the following upper triangular matrix:\n\n$\\begin{bmatrix} \n1& 1& 2& 2& 2\\\\ \n0& -1& -1& -1& -1\\\\ \n0& 0& -2& -1& -1\\\\ \n0& 0& 0& -3/2& -1/2\\\\ \n0& 0& 0& 0& -4/3\n\\end{bmatrix}$Step 2:\n\nlet $U = \\begin{bmatrix} \n1& 1& 2& 2& 2\\\\ \n0& -1& -1& -1& -1\\\\ \n0& 0& -2& -1& -1\\\\ \n0& 0& 0& -3/2& -1/2\\\\ \n0& 0& 0& 0& -4/3\n\\end{bmatrix}$Then\n$\\text{det}(A) = \\text{det}(U) = \\text{ product of diagonal entries} = 1\\times-1\\times-2\\times-\\frac{3}{2}\\times-\\frac{4}{3} = 4$Thus $\\text{det}(A) = 4$"

        "One can do this by just charging ahead and either using the definition\nor using row operations to get the matrix into an upper diagonal matrix\n(see solution 2) but there is a more elegant way to solve this (this\nwill be solution 1).",

        "The product of the eigenvalues $\\displaystyle \\lambda_{i}$ of a matrix\n$\\displaystyle X$ is equal to the determinant. This follows since\n\n$\\displaystyle \\det(X-\\lambda I ) = (\\lambda_{1}-\\lambda)(\\lambda_{2}-\\lambda)...(\\lambda_{n}-\\lambda)$Then plug in $\\displaystyle \\lambda = 0$ into both sides of the\nequation.
