        "For $f(x,y)$ to have a local maximum or minimum at a point $(a,b)$, that\npoint needs to be a critical point, that is\n\n\\[\\displaystyle\nf_x (a,b) = f_y (a,b) = 0\\]\n\nFor the function\n\n\\[\\displaystyle\nf(x,y) = x^3 y - 8y - 5x\\] we have the partial derivatives\n\n\\[\\displaystyle\nf_x = 3x^2 y - 5 \\quad\\text{and}\\quad f_y = x^3 - 8\\]\n\nTo look for critical points, we need to find points which yield a zero\nin both partial derivatives. Looking in particular at the partial\nderivative with respect to \\emph{y} we observe that if\n\n\\[\\displaystyle\nf_y = 0\\] then\n\n\\[\\displaystyle\nx^3 - 8 = 0\\] and so\n\n\\[\\displaystyle\nx = 2.\\]\n\nTaking this value of $x$ and substituting it into the equation for the\npartial derivative with respect to $x$ yields\n\n\\[\\displaystyle\n3 \\cdot 2^2 y - 5 = 0\\] so\n\n\\[\\displaystyle\n12y = 5\\] or\n\n\\[\\displaystyle\ny=5/12\\]\n\nWe find only one critical point,\n\n\\[(a,b) = \\left(2,\\frac{5}{12}\\right).\\]\n\nSince in order to be a relative maximum or minimum, the point must be a\ncritical point, we have found that the only point that \\textbf{may} be a\nmaximum or minimum is (2,5/12).\n\n\\textbf{Continuing the Problem:}\n\nIf we assume the second derivative test is applicable (sometimes it is\ninconclusive), we need\n\n\\[\\displaystyle\nf_{xx}(a,b) f_{yy}(a,b) - f_{xy}^2(a,b) > 0\\] to have a relative maximum\nor minimum.\n\nIf we compute the second derivatives, we find\n\n\\begin{align*}\nf_{xx}(x,y) &= \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(3x^2 y - 5) = 6xy\\\\\nf_{yy}(x,y) &= \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(x^3 - 8) = 0\\\\\nf_{xy}(x,y) &= \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(3x^2 y - 5) = 3x^2\n\\end{align*} and so\n\n\\begin{align*}\nf_{xx}(a,b) &=6 \\cdot 2 \\cdot \\frac{5}{12} = 5\\\\\nf_{yy}(a,b) &= 0\\\\\nf_{xy}(a,b) &= 3 \\cdot 2^2 = 12\n\\end{align*}\n\nThus,\n\n\\[\\displaystyle\nf_{xx}(a,b) f_{yy}(a,b) - f_{xy}^2(a,b) = 0 - 12^2 = -144\\]\n\nSince this is a negative number, this critical point is a saddle point\nand so the conclusion is that the critical point is not a relative\nmaximum or minimum and since there is only one critical point, there are\nno relative maxima/minima for $f(x,y)$."
