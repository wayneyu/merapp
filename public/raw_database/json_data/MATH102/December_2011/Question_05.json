        "To determine the absolute max and min of the function f(x) on the\ninterval we need to determine the critical points of the function and\nevaluate the function f(x) at those points, as well as the endpoints of\nthe interval. The absolute max(min) of f(x) on the interval $[0,2\\pi]$\nis given by the greatest(least) value of the function at those points.\n\nTo determine the critical points, we evaluate solve $f'(x) = 0$ for $x$.\n\n\\[0= f'(x) = \\cos(x) + \\sin(x)  .\\]\n\nand thus when $\\cos(x) \\neq 0$\n\n$\\displaystyle -1 = \\frac{\\sin(x)}{\\cos(x)} = \\tan(x)$\n\nIf $\\cos(x)$ is 0, then we know that $x = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$ or\n$x = \\frac{3\\pi}{2}$. At these points, $\\sin(x) \\neq 0$ and thus\n$0 \\neq \\cos(x) + \\sin(x)$. Hence we may suppose that $\\cos(x) \\neq 0$.\n\nWe know that $\\displaystyle \\tan(x)$ is negative in the second and\nfourth quadrants. We also know that a right triangle with side lengths\n$\\displaystyle 1:1:\\sqrt{2}$ has angles $\\displaystyle \\frac{\\pi}{4}$,\n$\\displaystyle \\frac{\\pi}{4}$ and $\\displaystyle \\frac{\\pi}{2}$. Thus,\nwe have that $\\displaystyle x =  \\frac{3\\pi}{4}$ and\n$\\displaystyle x = \\frac{7\\pi}{4}$ (see the diagram below).\n\n\\begin{figure}[htbp]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=.5\\textwidth]{TanxMath100Dec2010.jpg}\n\\caption{TanxMath100Dec2010.jpg}\n\\end{figure}\n\nThus, we plug in all these values to see that\n\n$\\displaystyle f(0) = \\sin(0) - \\cos(0) = -1$\n\n$\\displaystyle f(\\tfrac{3\\pi}{4}) = \\sin(\\tfrac{3\\pi}{4}) - \\cos(\\tfrac{3\\pi}{4}) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} - \\frac{-1}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\sqrt{2}$\n\n$\\displaystyle f(\\tfrac{7\\pi}{4}) = \\sin(\\tfrac{7\\pi}{4}) - \\cos(\\tfrac{7\\pi}{4}) = \\frac{-1}{\\sqrt{2}} - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{-2}{\\sqrt{2}} = -\\sqrt{2}$\n\n$\\displaystyle f(2\\pi) = \\sin(2\\pi) - \\cos(2\\pi) = 0 - 1 = -1$\n\nand thus, the maximum occurs at $\\displaystyle \\tfrac{3\\pi}{4}$ and its\nvalue is $\\displaystyle \\sqrt{2}$ and the minimum occurs at\n$\\displaystyle \\tfrac{7\\pi}{4}$ and its value is\n$\\displaystyle -\\sqrt{2}$", 
        "Proceed as in solution one to see that\n\n\\[f'(x) = \\cos(x) + \\sin(x) = 0 \\quad \\rightarrow \\quad \\cos(x) = -\\sin(x).\\]\nSolving this equation may appear difficult but if we consider some basic\ntrigonometry, it should be no trouble. Consider this drawing of a right\ntriangle with hypotenuse of length H, and an angle x with adjacent and\nopposite sides of lengths A, O respectively.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htbp]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=.5\\textwidth]{A_right_triangle.png}\n\\caption{A right triangle.png}\n\\end{figure}\n\nThe following relations hold:\n\n\\[\\cos(x) = \\frac{A}{H}, \\quad \\sin(x) = \\frac{O}{H}.\\] To determine the\nangles, x, that satisfy the relation $\\cos(x) = -\\sin(x)$, we substitute\nthe above relations and get\n\n\\[\\frac{A}{H} = -\\frac{O}{H} \\quad \\rightarrow \\quad A = -O.\\]\nTherefore, angles with adjacent side length equal to the opposite side\nlength, but with one extending in the negative direction and one in the\npositive direction are the solutions to our above equation. This implies\nthat the magnitudes of the sides are equal and must occur in the second\nand fourth quadrants. A right triangle with two sides equal must have\nangles $\\displaystyle \\frac{\\pi}{4}$, $\\displaystyle \\frac{\\pi}{4}$ and\n$\\displaystyle \\frac{\\pi}{2}$. Hence, the angles of the triangles we\nrequire are (in the second and fourth quadrants respectively - see the\nprevious solution for the picture)\n\n\\[x = \\frac{3\\pi}{4}, \\frac{7\\pi}{4}\\] and thus, they are our critical\npoints. Evaluating $f(x)$ at the critical points and the endpoints we\nget the following:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n&f(0) = 0 - 1 = -1, \\quad f\\left(\\frac{3\\pi}{4}\\right) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} - \\frac{-1}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\sqrt{2}\\\\\n&f\\left(\\frac{7\\pi}{4}\\right) = \\frac{-1}{\\sqrt{2}} - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} = -\\sqrt{2}, \\quad f\\left(2\\pi\\right) = 0 - 1 = -1\n\\end{align*} Therefore, we can see that this function has a unique\nabsolute maximum and unique absolute minimum:\n\n\\[{\\color{blue}\\mbox{Abs max} = f\\left(\\frac{3\\pi}{4}\\right) = \\sqrt{2}, \\quad \\mbox{Abs min} = f\\left(\\frac{7\\pi}{4}\\right) = -\\sqrt{2}}\\]"
