        "Picard's theorem (at least one version of it) states that initial value\nproblems of the form $\\frac{dy}{dx} = f(x,y), \\quad y(x_0) = y_0$ have a\nunique solution over some interval I containing $x_0$ provided f is\ncontinuous at $(x_0, y_0)$.\n\nIf we rearrange the ODE problem $y \\frac{dy}{dx} = x, \\quad y(0) = 0$,\nwe get $\\frac{dy}{dx} = \\frac{x}{y}, \\quad y(0) = 0$. When $x=0$, $y=0$,\nbut $\\displaystyle \\frac{x}{y}$ is not continuous at (0,0) because it is\nnot defined. Therefore the theorem cannot be used and uniqueness is not\nguaranteed."
