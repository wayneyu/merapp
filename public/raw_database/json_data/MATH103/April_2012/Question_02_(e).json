Show in detail how you arrive at your\nanswer (work will be considered for this problem).}\n\nIn (a simplified version of) the dice game\n\\href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pass_the_Pigs}{\\emph{Pass the Pigs}}\ntwo model pigs serve as dice. Each model pig can either land on the side\n(with probability \\emph{p}(\\emph{S}) = 4/8), on the feet (with\nprobability \\emph{p}(\\emph{F}) = 3/8), or on the snout (with probability\n\\emph{p}(\\emph{N}) = 1/8). In each turn both model pigs are rolled. The\nscoring is as follows:\n\n\\begin{longtable}[c]{@{}llll@{}}\n& pig 1 side & pig 1 feet & pig 1 snout\\\\\n\n\\textbf{pig 2 side} & 0 & 1 & 5\\\\\n\\textbf{pig 2 feet} & 1 & 3 & 7\\\\\n\\textbf{pig 2 snout} & 5 & 7 & 10\\\\\\\\\n\\end{longtable}\n\nFind the average score per turn. \\textbf{You can leave your answer\nunsimplified as a sum of fractions.}",

        "This game has 9 outcomes, but due to symmetry only 6 of them are\ndistinct. The probabilities are distributed as follows (multiples of\n1/64)\n\n\\begin{longtable}[c]{@{}llll@{}}\n& pig 1 side & pig 1 feet & pig 1 snout\\\\\n\n\\textbf{pig 2 side} & 4 \u00d7 4 & 4 \u00d7 3 & 4 \u00d7 1\\\\\n\\textbf{pig 2 feet} & 3 \u00d7 4 & 3 \u00d7 3 & 3 \u00d7 1\\\\\n\\textbf{pig 2 snout} & 1 \u00d7 4 & 1 \u00d7 3 & 1 \u00d7 1\\\\\\\\\n\\end{longtable}\n\nLet \\emph{X} be the random variable that returns the score. Then\n\n\\begin{align*}\np(X = 0) &= \\frac{16}{64} &\np(X = 1) &= 2\\frac{12}{64} &\np(X = 5) &= 2\\frac{4}{64} \\\\\np(X = 3) &= \\frac{9}{64} &\np(X = 7) &= 2\\frac{3}{64} &\np(X = 10) &= \\frac{1}{64}\n\\end{align*}\n\nand thus the average $\\mu$ is found to be\n\n\\begin{align*}\n\\mu &= 0p(X=0) + 1p(X=1) + 3p(X = 3) + 5p(X = 5) + 7p(X=7) + 10p(X = 10) \\\\\n&= 2\\frac{12}{64} + 3\\frac{9}{64} + 10 \\frac{4}{64} + 14\\frac{3}{64} +10\\frac{1}{64}\\quad  \\left(=\\frac{143}{64} \\approx 2.23.\\right)\n\\end{align*}"

        "Remember that the average number of points should be\n\n\\begin{align*}\n0 p(X = 0) + 1 p(X=1) + 3 p(X=3) + 5 p(X=5) + 7p(X=7) + 10p(X=10), \n\\end{align*}\n\nwhere $X$ is a random variable representing the number of points.

        "We can find the probability that $X$ is equal to a given value by\nlooking at all of the different combinations of rolls that can give a\nvalue for $X$. For example:\n\n\\begin{align*}\np(X=1) &= p(\\text{pig 1 lands on its side and pig 2 lands on its feet}) \\\\ & + p(\\text{pig 2 lands on its side and pig 1 lands on its feet})\\\\\np(X=1) &= \\left(\\frac{3}{8}\\right) \\left( \\frac{4}{8} \\right) + \\left( \\frac{3}{8} \\right) \\left( \\frac{4}{8} \\right) = \\frac{24}{64}.\n\\end{align*}\n\nNow, perform the same calculation for the other possible values of $X$."
