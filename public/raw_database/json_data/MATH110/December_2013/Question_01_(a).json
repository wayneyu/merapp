        "\\textbf{Note: The first three parts of this question was identical to\nthat of the October Midterm.}\\\\\\textbf{True:} There are multiple ways to\nsee this.\n\nSolve the quadratic equation.\n\nThe function expands to\\begin{align*}f(x) = \\frac{1}{2}x^2+3x+\\frac{7}{2}.\\end{align*} Which\nthen gives:\n\n\\begin{align*}\nx&= \\frac{-3 \\pm \\sqrt{9 - 4\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\left(\\frac{7}{2}\\right)}}{2\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)}\\\\\n &= \\frac{-3 \\pm \\sqrt{9 - 7}}{1}\\\\\nx &= -3 \\pm \\sqrt{2}\\\\end{align*}", 
        "We can also use the vertex formula by seeing that\n$f(x) =\\frac{1}{2}(x+3)^2-1$, with vertex $(-3,-1)$ which is below the\n\\emph{x}-axis. Next, observe that a parabola is continuous (because its\na polynomial). Combining this with the fact that the parabola has a\npositive coefficient of $\\frac{1}{2}$, meaning that the parabola is\ncurving upwards, we get that it must cross the $x$ axis.", 
        "We can view this as a graph transformation of $y=x^2$ which touches the\n$x$-axis. Then we shift it $3$ to the left and then $2$ down, so it\nstill touches the $x$-axis. This is then followed by a vertical\ncompression of $2$ (or expansion by $0.5$). This does not change\ndirection of curvature of the function and so it must still touch the\n$x$-axis.", 
        "We can also use the IVT. The function is a quadratic and hence is\ncontinuous. We then look at $f(-3) = -1 <0$ and then $f(0) = 3.5 >0$.\nThus there must be a point between $-3$ and $0$ that crosses the\n$x$-axis."

    "hints": [
        "There are multiple ways to see this and each hint corresponds to each\nsolution.\n\nFor a hint to the first solution, you could always just try to solve\nthis directly using the quadratic formula.", 
        "You could also try to solve this be exploiting the fact that the\nparabola is given in vertex form.", 
        "One could also reason by starting with the parabola\n$\\displaystyle y = x^{2}$ and from here trying to get the given parabola\nby a series of transformations. Argue how these transformations affect\nthe number of roots of the parabola.", 
        "One could also use the Intermediate Value Theorem (IVT) to solve this\nproblem."
