        "First we find an formula for the quantity we're minimizing: the slope of\nthe tangent line. This formula is the derivative of the function:\n\n\\begin{align*}\\displaystyle f'(x) = 3 - \\sqrt{3} \\sin x - \\cos x\\end{align*}\n\nThis is the formula we are minimizing, which we will now call\n$\\displaystyle g(x) = 3 - \\sqrt{3} \\sin x - \\cos x$. Following our usual\nprocedure for finding maxima/minima, we take the derivative of\n\\emph{g(x)}, set it equal to zero, and solve for the critical points.\n\n\\begin{align*}g'(x) = -\\sqrt{3}\\cos x + \\sin x\\end{align*}\n\nSetting equal to zero and solving gives:\n\n\\begin{align*}\\sqrt{3} \\cos x = \\sin x\\end{align*}\n\nSo we are looking for an angle where $\\sin(x)$ is equal to\n$\\sqrt{3}\\cos(x)$. There is no ``formula'' to solve this equation;\ninstead you have to use trig ratios and special triangles, or consult\nthe unit circle. On a 30-60-90 degree triangle, or at the angles 30 (in\nradians: \\emph{x = $\\pi$/6}) and 60 (in radians: \\emph{x = $\\pi$/3}) on the unit\ncircle, $\\sin(x)$ and $\\cos(x)$ are related in a ratio of $1 : \\sqrt{3}$\nso these angles are our candidates. At these values we have\n\n\\begin{align*}\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}6\\right) = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}2, \\quad \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}6\\right) = \\frac12\\end{align*}\n\n\\begin{align*}\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}3\\right) = \\frac12, \\quad \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}3\\right) = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}2\\end{align*}\n\nHence \\emph{x = $\\pi$/3} is the solution of equation and hence our critical\npoint. We check if this point is indeed a minimum by performing the\nfirst derivative test:\n\n\\begin{longtable}[c]{@{}llll@{}}\n& $(0, \\pi/3)$ & $x = \\pi/3$ & $(\\pi/3, \\pi/2)$\\\\\n$\\displaystyle g'(x)$ & - & 0 & +\\\\\n$\\displaystyle g(x)$ & decreasing & min & increasing\\\\\n\\end{longtable}\n\nHence the tangent line \\emph{g(x)} has the smallest slope when \\emph{x =\n$\\pi$/3}.\n\n\\emph{Note that we do not need to check the endpoints of the interval,\nbecause neither is included in the domain.}"

        "See the word ``smallest''? -{}- this is an optimization question. But\nread carefully; what is being minimized here?",
