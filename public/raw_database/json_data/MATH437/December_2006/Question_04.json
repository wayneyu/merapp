        "(a) Since $\\displaystyle 6! = 2^{4} \\cdot 3^{2} \\cdot5$, Fermat's\ntheorem says that in case (a) we must have a solution. (The curiously\nminded person should note that as $1^{2} + 2^{2} = 5$ then multiplying\nboth sides by $12^{2}$ gives $\\displaystyle 12^{2} + 24^{2} = 6!$).\n\n(b) As $\\displaystyle 11 \\parallel 12!$ and\n$\\displaystyle 11\\equiv 3 \\mod{4}$, this case has no solutions.\n\n(c) As $\\displaystyle 23 \\parallel 24!$ and\n$\\displaystyle 23 \\equiv 3 \\mod{4}$, this case has no solutions.\n\n(d) As $\\displaystyle 47 \\parallel 48!$ and\n$\\displaystyle 47 \\equiv 3 \\mod{4}$, this case has no solutions."
