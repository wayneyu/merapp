If a box is provided, write your final answer there.\nSimplification of answers is not required unless explicitly requested.\n\nCobblestone Engineering has been contracted to build a bridge and a\npathway from Calculus City located at point A on the shoreline of a 6km\nwide river that runs west to east, to a power plant at point B on the\nopposite shoreline, 8km to the east. It costs 40 dollars per km to build\na bridge over the river and 20 dollars per km to build a pathway along a\nshoreline. How should the company proceed in order to minimize the total\ncost? Be sure to justify that the total cost is indeed a minimum.",

        "According to the picture,\n\n\\begin{figure}[htbp]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=.5\\textwidth]{BridgeMath101Dec2010.jpg}\n\\caption{BridgeMath101Dec2010.jpg}\n\\end{figure}\n\nThus, the cost equation is\n\n$\\displaystyle C = 40d + 20(8-x)$\n\nTo get this in terms of one variable, note by the Pythagorean theorem,\nwe have\n\n$\\displaystyle d^{2} = 6^{2} + x^{2}$\n\nHence, we have\n\n$\\displaystyle C = 40\\sqrt{36+x^{2}} + 20(8-x)$\n\nDifferentiating yields\n\n\\begin{align*}\nC' &= \\frac{40(2x)}{2\\sqrt{36+x^{2}}} -20\\\\\n&= \\frac{40x - 20\\sqrt{36+x^{2}}}{\\sqrt{36 + x^{2}}}\\end{align*}\n\nSetting the derivative to 0 yields\n\n\\begin{align*}\n0 &= \\frac{40x - 20\\sqrt{36+x^{2}}}{\\sqrt{36 + x^{2}}}\\\\\n0 &= 40x - 20\\sqrt{36+x^{2}} \\\\\n\\sqrt{36+x^{2}} &= 2x  \\\\\n36+x^{2} &= 4x^{2}  \\\\\n36 &= 3x^{2}  \\\\\n12 &= x^{2}  \\\\\n\\pm 2\\sqrt{3} &= x  \\end{align*}\n\nNotice that the negative answer is inadmissable since it corresponds to\na side length (and \\emph{x} should be positive to minimize cost). Now,\nthe endpoints are \\emph{x} = 0 and \\emph{x} = 8. Then,\n\n$\\displaystyle C(0) = 40\\sqrt{36+0^{2}} + 20(8-0) = 240 + 160 = 400$\n\n\\begin{align*}\nC(2\\sqrt{3}) &= 40\\sqrt{36+(2\\sqrt{3})^{2}} + 20(8-2\\sqrt{3}) \\\\\n&= 40\\sqrt{36 + 12} + 160 - 40\\sqrt{3} \\\\\n&= 160\\sqrt{3} + 160 - 40\\sqrt{3} \\\\\n&= 120\\sqrt{3} + 160 < 400 \\end{align*}\n\n$\\displaystyle C(8) = 40\\sqrt{36+8^{2}} + 20(8-8) = 40\\sqrt{100} = 400$\n\nand so the minimum occurs at $\\displaystyle x = 2\\sqrt{3}$"
