        "The hints should explain most of what's going on. Here is the output.\nFor A=ones(4,4) we get\n\n$A = \\begin{bmatrix}\n1 &1 &1 &1\\\\\n1 &1 &1 &1\\\\\n1 &1 &1 &1\\\\\n1 &1 &1 &1\n\\end{bmatrix}$\n\nThen after the loop executes for j=1, we get\n\n$A = \\begin{bmatrix}\n1 &1 &1 &1\\\\\n1 &1 &1 &1\\\\\n1 &1 &1 &1\\\\\n1 &1 &1 &1\n\\end{bmatrix}$\n\n(which is the same as the original A). After j=2, the matrix looks like\n\n$A = \\begin{bmatrix}\n1 &1 &1 &1\\\\\n2 &2 &2 &2\\\\\n1 &1 &1 &1\\\\\n1 &1 &1 &1\n\\end{bmatrix}$\n\nAfter j=3, the matrix looks like\n\n$A = \\begin{bmatrix}\n1 &1 &1 &1\\\\\n2 &2 &2 &2\\\\\n3 &3 &3 &3\\\\\n1 &1 &1 &1\n\\end{bmatrix}$\n\nLastly, when the loop hits its final value of j=4, the matrix looks like\n\n$A = \\begin{bmatrix}\n1 &1 &1 &1\\\\\n2 &2 &2 &2\\\\\n3 &3 &3 &3\\\\\n4 &4 &4 &4\n\\end{bmatrix}$\n\nFinally, the code A(2,4) looks in row two column 4 for the value. The\nanswer is 2."
