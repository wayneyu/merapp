    "statement": "Stalagmites are cone-shaped mineral deposits which rise from the floors\nof limestone caves. They form over millenia as dripping water deposits\ncalcium carbonate onto the cave floor.\n\nConsider a cone-shaped stalagmite with a length always equal to five\ntimes its radius. Suppose the stalagmite's height increases at a rate of\n0.13 millimetres per year. Write down two expressions for the rate of\nchange of its volume: \\emph{(i)} with respect to its height \\emph{h},\nand \\emph{(ii)} with respect to its radius \\emph{r}.\n\nHint: the volume \\emph{V} of a cone with radius \\emph{r} and height\n\\emph{h} is equal to $\\frac13 \\pi r^2h$.",

        "We are given the volume of a cone.\n\n\\begin{align*}V = \\frac13 \\pi r^2 h\\end{align*}\n\nIf we differentiate this expression as it is, we will end up with an\nexpression relating $dV/dt$ to both variables of \\emph{r} and \\emph{h}.\nTo avoid this, we need to write the volume formula in terms of just\n\\emph{r} or \\emph{h}, by writing one variable in terms of another. The\nquestion states that the length of the stalagmite is always five times\nits radius, so we can write $h  = 5r$, or, alternatively, $r = h/5$.\n\n\\emph{(i) Finding an expression in terms of h}: Using $r = h/5$, we plug\nit into our volume formula to get\n\n\\begin{align*}\nV &= \\frac13 \\pi \\left(\\frac{h}{5}\\right)^2 h\\\\\n&= \\frac13 \\pi \\frac{h^3}{25} \\end{align*}\n\nDifferentiating yields\n\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{dV}{dt} &= \\frac13 \\pi \\frac{3h^2}{25}\\frac{dh}{dt}\\\\\n&= \\frac{\\pi h^2}{25} \\frac{dh}{dt} \\end{align*}\n\nAnd because we know that $dh/dt = 0.13$ mm/year, we finally reach an\nexpression relating the rate of change in volume to the height \\emph{h}\n\n\\begin{align*}\\frac{dV}{dt} = \\frac{\\pi h^2}{25} 0.13\\end{align*}\n\n\\emph{(ii) Finding an expression in terms of r}: To find an expression\nin terms of \\emph{r} we simply use the relationship \\emph{h = 5r} to get\n\n\\begin{align*}\nV &= \\frac13 \\pi r^2 (5r)\\\\\n&= \\frac53 \\pi r^3 \\end{align*}\n\nDifferentiating yields\n\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{dV}{dt} &= \\frac53 \\pi 3r^2 \\frac{dr}{dt}\\\\\n&= 5\\pi r^2\\frac{dr}{dt} \\end{align*}\n\nTo find an expression for $dV/dt$ solely in terms of $r$, we need to\nfind $dr/dt$. We can do this by differentiating the equation $h = 5r$ to\nget\n\n\\begin{align*}\\frac{dh}{dt} = 5\\frac{dr}{dt}\\end{align*}\n\n\\begin{align*}\\frac{0.13}{5} = \\frac{dr}{dt}\\end{align*}\n\nPlugging this into our formula for $dV/dt$ gives\n\n\\begin{align*}\\frac{dV}{dt} &= 5\\pi r^2 \\frac{0.13}{5} \\\\\n&= \\pi 0.13 r^2\\end{align*}\n\nin terms of \\emph{r}, as desired."

        "What fact about the proportions of the stalagmite can you use to relate\nthe variables \\emph{r} and \\emph{h}? Once you have done this, you can\nwrite the volume formula either in terms of \\emph{h} (for part i) or\n\\emph{r} (for part ii).",
