Multiplying the first by 5 and the second\nequation by 8 gives\n\n\\begin{align*}\n5px &= 40n + 15 \\\\\n8py &= 40n + 16 \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\nsubtracting the two equations gives $\\displaystyle p(8y-5x) = 1$ and as\n\\emph{p} is prime, it divides the left hand side but not the right hand\nside which is a contradiction. Hence no such prime number can exist."
