        "Let \u03b5 \\textgreater{} 0, we want to show that for some positive integer\n\\emph{N}\\textsubscript{\u03b5}, we have that\n\n\\[\\left| \\left( -\\frac{2}{3} \\right)^n \\right| < \\varepsilon \\quad \\text{if } n \\geq N_\\varepsilon\\]\nFirst, we can get rid of the absolute value since\n\n\\[\\left| \\left( -\\frac{2}{3} \\right)^n \\right| = \\left( \\frac{2}{3} \\right)^n\\]\nand so we wonder if for some value of \\emph{n} large enough, we will\nhave\n\n\\[\\left( \\frac{2}{3} \\right)^n < \\varepsilon\\] for the value of \u03b5 that\nwe fixed (and that we think of as being a very small number). Since we\nare interested in the value of \\emph{n}, we take the logarithm on each\nside and obtain\n\n\\[\\underbrace{\\ln \\left[ \\left( \\frac{2}{3} \\right)^n \\right]}_{= n\\ln(2/3)} < \\ln (\\varepsilon)\\]\nNow since 2/3 is a number smaller than 1, its logarithm will be a\nnegative number, so when we divide in the above by ln(2/3) we have to\nflip the inequality sign, we obtain\n\n\\[n > \\frac{\\ln(\\varepsilon)}{\\ln(2/3)}\\] Note that since \u03b5 is also a\nvery small number, its logarithm is also negative and hence the fraction\non the right-hand side is a positive number (as expected). We can thus\nchoose \\emph{N}\\textsubscript{\u03b5} to be the nearest integer larger than\nthe fraction, which we can write as\n\n\\[N_\\varepsilon = \\left\\lceil \\frac{\\ln(\\varepsilon)}{\\ln(2/3)} \\right\\rceil\\]\nwhich concludes our proof.\n\n\\subsubsection{Note}\\label{note}\n\nIt is not a bad idea to see that \u03b5 proofs allow you to actually compute\nsomething about how quickly the sequence will converge to its limit. In\nthis case for example, if we choose \u03b5 = 0.001 then the above proof gives\nus the value\n\n\\[N_{0.001} = \\left\\lceil \\frac{\\ln(0.001)}{\\ln(2/3)} \\right\\rceil = \\left\\lceil 17.0366 \\right\\rceil = 18\\]\nSo for any \\emph{n} \u2265 18, the value of (-2/3)\\textsuperscript{\\emph{n}}\nshould be less than 0.001, indeed we have\n\n\\[\\left| \\left( -\\frac{2}{3} \\right)^{17} \\right| = 0.00101 \\quad\\text{and}\\quad \\left| \\left( -\\frac{2}{3} \\right)^{18} \\right| = 0.0006766\\]"
