        "\\emph{It's probably the case that you've seen a general formula in Math\n103 for this type of scenario and you are just being asked to recall it.\nThe correct answer is 3.5. In any case, here is a full derivation, which\nmight be useful for your review.}\n\nThis is a sequence of Bernoulli trials. We'll call rolling a 6\n``success'' and any other number ``failure''.\n\nIn a single roll, since 6 is twice as likely as all other numbers, the\nprobability of rolling a 6 must be 2/7 and the probability of rolling\nany other number must be 1/7. That is, the probability of success in one\ntrial is $p=2/7$ and the probability of failure is $q=5/7$.\n\nLet $N$ be the number of rolls until a 6 is obtained. For example, the\nprobability that $N=1$ is simply equal to the probability of success in\none trial,\n\n\\[\\displaystyle P(N=1)=p.\\]\n\n$N=2$ if and only the first trial resulted in failure \\textbf{and} the\nsecond trial resulted in success. Hence,\n\n\\[\\displaystyle P(N=2)=qp.\\]\n\nIn general, $N=k$ if and only if the first $k-1$ trials resulted in\nfailure and the $k^{th}$ trial resulted in success. Hence,\n\n\\[\\displaystyle P(N=k)=q^{k-1} p.\\]\n\nThis is the probability distribution for the random variable $N$. Our\ngoal is to compute the expected number of throws required to get a 6,\nwhich is precisely the mean value of $N$,\n\n\\begin{align*}\n\\overline N = \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty k P(N=k) =\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty k q^{k-1} p.\n\\end{align*}\n\nWe can compute the value of this sum by making the clever observation\nthat it appears to be the derivative of a geometric series. For any $x$\nin the interval $[0,1),$ define\n\n\\begin{align*}\nf(x)= \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty x^k p.\n\\end{align*}\n\nDifferentiating term-by-term, we see that\n\n\\begin{align*}\nf'(x)= \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty kx^{k-1} p.\n\\end{align*}\n\nHence, $\\overline N = f'(q).$\n\nHowever, $f(x)$ is simply a geometric series; the result is\n\n\\begin{align*}\nf(x)=  \\frac{p}{1-x}.\n\\end{align*}\n\nTherefore,\n\n\\begin{align*}\nf'(x)=  \\frac{p}{(1-x)^2}.\n\\end{align*}\n\nHence,\n\n\\begin{align*}\n\\overline N = f'(q)=  \\frac{p}{(1-q)^2} = \\frac{p}{p^2} = \\frac1{p} = \\frac72 = 3.5.\n\\end{align*}"
