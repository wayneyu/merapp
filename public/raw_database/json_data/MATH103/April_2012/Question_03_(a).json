        "The equation of a circle with radius 1 is\n\\emph{x}\\textsuperscript{2}+\\emph{y}\\textsuperscript{2}=1 or, once we\nsolve for $y$, $y=\\sqrt{1-x^2}$ (which gives the upper half of the\ncircle). Because we are rotating around the \\emph{x}-axis, we will be\nintegrating between two points on the \\emph{x}-axis. The left endpoint\nis clearly \\emph{0}. The right endpoint is a little trickier: it will be\nthe point where $y = x$ and $y = \\sqrt{1 - x^2}$ intersect. This point\nof intersection is found by setting these two curves equal and solving:\n\n\\begin{align*}\nx &= \\sqrt{1-x^2} \\\\ x^2 &= 1 - x^2  \\\\ x^2 &= \\frac12 \\\\ x &= \\pm\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\end{align*}.\n\nBecause we are in the first quadrant, the intersection point must be\npositive. Thus we will be integrating between $\\displaystyle 0$ and\n$\\frac1{\\sqrt{2}}.$\n\nIf we use the Disc Method, the outside radius of the disc will be the\narc of the circle, given by $y = \\sqrt{1-x^2}$ and the inside radius\nwill be given by the line $y = x$. Plugging these, and our endpoints,\ninto the integral, we get:\n\n\\begin{align*}\nV &= \\int_0^{\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}} \\pi \\left[\\left(\\sqrt{1-x^2}\\right)^2 - \\left(x\\right)^2\\right] dx \\\\\n&= \\int_0^{\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}} \\pi \\left[1-2x^2\\right] dx  \\\\\n&= \\pi \\left[ x-\\frac{2x^3}{3}\\right]_0^{\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}}  \\\\\n&= \\pi \\left[ \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}-\\frac{1}{3\\sqrt{2}}\\right] \\\\\n&= \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{3}\\pi\n\\end{align*}"

        "Because the expression is a function for x and is to be rotated about\nthe x-axis, we should use the disc method. When using the disc method,\nwe want to evaluate the integral\n\n\\[\\pi \\int_a^b [f(x)^2 - g(x)^2] dx\\] where a and b are the smallest and\nlargest values of x in the region, f(x) is the largest y-value in the\nregion at x (which will be the outer radius of the disc) , and g(x) is\nthe smallest y-value in the region at x (which will be the inner radius\nof the disc).\n\nFor this region, we have that $a = 0$. The rightmost x-value $b$ is the\npoint of intersection of the circle $x^2 + y^2 = 1$ and the line\n$y = x$. Try to find the value of b and evaluate the integral."
