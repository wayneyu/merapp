The balls in the first\nbox are numbered \u00e2\u0088\u00921 and 1, the balls in the second box are numbered 0\nand 2. An experimenter draws a ball from each box and observes the\nnumber of each ball. Define a random variable \\emph{X} whose value is\ntwo times the number of the ball drawn from the first box plus three\ntimes the number of the ball drawn from the second box. In other words,\n\n\\emph{X} = 2(number observed from box 1) + 3(number observed from box\n2).\n\nWrite down all possible values of \\emph{X} and use this to compute the\nexpected value of \\emph{X}.",

        "We consider all possible outcomes.\n\nDraw -1 from bin 1 and 0 from bin 2\\[X = 2(-1) + 3(0) = -2.\\]\n\nDraw -1 from bin 1 and 2 from bin 2\\[X = 2(-1) + 3(2) = 4.\\]\n\nDraw +1 from bin 1 and 0 from bin 2\\[X = 2(1) + 3(0) = 2.\\]\n\nDraw +1 from bin 1 and 2 from bin 2\\[X = 2(1) + 3(2) = 8.\\]\n\nAll possible values of X are: -2, 2, 4, 8.\n\nEach outcome is equally likely since drawing from the bins is\nindependent and within each bin the balls have equal probability (this\nisn't mentioned, but it seems like a reasonable assumption). Therefore,\n$\\Pr(X=-2) = \\Pr(X=2) = \\Pr(X=4) = \\Pr(X=8) = 1/4$ (since the sum of all\n4 probabilities must be 1).\n\nThe expected value of X\nis\\[\\mathbb{E}(X) = -2/4 + 2/4 + 4/4 + 8/4 = 3.\\]"

    "hints": [
        "There are four possible outcomes for the experiment and hence \\emph{X}\ncan take four possible values. Try listing them out. All outcomes are\nequally likely."
