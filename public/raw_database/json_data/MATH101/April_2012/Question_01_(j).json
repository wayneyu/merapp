Give the\nbest upper bound you can for $|I-a|$.",

        "The Maclauren series of the integrand is found by:\n\n\\begin{align*}\nx^{4}e^{-x^{2}} \n&= x^{4}\\left(1+\\left(-x^{2}\\right)+\\left(-x^{2}\\right)^{2}/\\left(2!\\right)+\\left(-x^{2}\\right)^{3}/\\left(3!\\right)+\\cdots\\right) \\\\\n&= x^{4}-x^{6}+x^{8}/2-x^{10}/6+\\dots\\end{align*}\n\nTherefore, integrating term-by-term gives:\n\n\\begin{align*}I=\\int_{0}^{1}x^{4}e^{-x^{2}}dx = 1/5-1/7+1/18-1/66+\\dots\\end{align*}\n\nThis confirms the given approximation, $\\displaystyle a = 1/5-1/7+1/18.$\n\nMoreover, this shows that the integral can be represented by an\nalternating series in the form\n\n\\begin{align*}\\sum_{n=1}^k (-1)^{n-1}a_n\\end{align*}\n\nSince the positive numbers \\emph{a}\\textsubscript{\\emph{n}} are\nevidently monotonically decreasing, the \\emph{Alternating Series\nEstimation Theorem} then says that an error bound of a partial sum can\nbe given by the next term \\emph{a}\\textsubscript{\\emph{k}+1}. In this\ncase, the statement translates to the bound:\n\n\\begin{align*}\\displaystyle \n|I-a|\\leq1/66\\end{align*}"

        "Direct integration is not an option because the anti-derivative of\n\\emph{x}\\textsuperscript{4}\\emph{e}\\textsuperscript{-\\emph{x}\\textsuperscript{2}}\ncan not be calculated.\n\nInstead, start by writing the integrand as a series and then integrate\nterm-by-term. Recall that\n\n\\begin{align*}e^x = \\sum_{n = 0}^\\infty \\frac{x^n}{n!}\\end{align*}", 
        "The nature of the resulting series representation of the integral then\nsuggests \\emph{a certain theorem} to find your error bound."
