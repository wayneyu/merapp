Simplify your answer as much as possible\nand show your work.}\n\nLet $\\displaystyle s = f(t) = t^3 - \\frac{21}2t^2 + 30t$ be the position\nfunction of a particle that is moving in a straight line, where \\emph{t}\nis measured in seconds and \\emph{s} in metres. When is the particle\nmoving in the negative direction?",

        "When the particle is moving in the \\emph{negative direction}, its\nvelocity is \\emph{negative}. Therefore we must look for the $t$ for\nwhich $\\frac{ds}{dt} = f'(t) < 0$:\n\n\\begin{align*}\ns &= t^3 - \\frac{21}{2}t^2 + 30t\n\\\\ \\frac{ds}{dt} &= 3t^2 - 21t + 30\\end{align*}\n\nSetting the derivative (i.e., the velocity function) equal to zero, we\nobtain $\\displaystyle 0 = 3t^2 - 21t + 30 = 3(t-2)(t-5)$. Hence the\nvelocity is zero when $\\displaystyle t = 2,\\,5$.\n\nPlugging in values tells us that $\\frac{ds}{dt} = f'(t) < 0$ on the\ninterval ${\\color{blue} t \\in (2,5)}$, where $t$ is in seconds as\nstated above."
