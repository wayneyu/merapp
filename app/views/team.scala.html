<h1> Our Goal </h1>

The Math Educational Resources is a community project started in February 2012 by a group of graduate students in the UBC Math Department. The goal of this project is to provide an open and free educational resource to undergraduate students taking math courses at UBC and elsewhere, with a strong emphasis on first and second year courses.

We are (also) hosted on the <a href="http://wiki.ubc.ca/Science:Math_Exam_Resources">UBC Wiki</a>, and received tremendous support from <a href="https://twitter.com/warcode">Warren Code</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/infology">Will Engle</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/scottmcmillan">Scott McMillan</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/supernova_k">Novak Rogic</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/cindyu">Cindy Underhill</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/hummus_monster">Ido Roll</a> and many others. As a founding member, <a href="https://twitter.com/davidkohler">David Kohler</a> had a huge part in getting this project off and running.
