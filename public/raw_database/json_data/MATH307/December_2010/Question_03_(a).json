Assume that\n\n\\begin{align*}f(x) = \\begin{cases}\np_1(x) & \\text{for } x_1 \\leq x \\leq x_2 \\\\\np_2(x) & \\text{for } x_2 \\leq x \\leq x_3 \\\\\np_3(x) & \\text{for } x_3 \\leq x \\leq x_4\n\\end{cases}\\end{align*}\n\nwhere each \\emph{p}\\textsubscript{i}(\\emph{x}) is a polynomial.\n\n\\textbf{(a)} What equations, written in terms of\n\\emph{p}\\textsubscript{i}(\\emph{x}) and possibly their derivatives,\nexpress the condition that \\emph{$f$(x)} goes through the given points?

        "Since the piece-wise function above has inclusive restrictions, we can\nsee that both polynomials, $p_1$ and $p_2$, have the same value\n$f(x_2)$. The same goes for polynomials $p_2$ and $p_3$.\n\nThus, we need to satisfy\n\n\\begin{align*}\\displaystyle p_i(x) = p_{i+1}(x)\\end{align*}\n\nTherefore,\n\n\\begin{align*}\np_1(x_2) = p_2(x_2)\\\\\np_2(x_3) = p_3(x_3)\\end{align*}\n\nHence these equations imply that $f(x)$ is continuous as they show that\nboth polynomials surrounding the given point equal each other at $x_i$.\n\nAs well, to show that the function goes through the given points, we\nneed to write the following six equations:\n\n\\begin{align*}\np_{1}(x_{1}) = y_{1}\\\\\np_{1}(x_{2}) = y_{2}\\\\\np_{2}(x_{2}) = y_{2}\\\\\np_{2}(x_{3}) = y_{3}\\\\\np_{3}(x_{3}) = y_{3}\\\\\np_{3}(x_{4}) = y_{4}\\end{align*}"
