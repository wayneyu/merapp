        "To determine the values of $t$ where $f(t)$ is increasing, we must solve\nfor the critical points of $f(t)$ and examine the sign of the derivative\nin between the critical points, solving $f'(t) = 0$ gives\n\n\\begin{align*}\n\\displaystyle f'(t) &= 0\\\\\n2t\\exp(t) + t^{2}\\exp(t) &= 0\\\\\n(t^{2} + 2t)\\exp(t) &= 0.\n\\end{align*} Since the exponential function is never zero for any value\nof $t$, we can solve the above equation by solving\n\n\\begin{align*}\n\\displaystyle t^{2} + 2t &= 0\\\\\nt(t + 2) &= 0, \\quad \\rightarrow \\quad t = 0,\\,-2\n\\end{align*} Now we need to evaluate the sign of $f'(t)$ in the\nintervals $(-\\infty,-2), (-2,0), (0,\\infty)$. Taking test points\n$t = -3,-1,1$ and plugging them into $f'(t)$ gives:\n\n\\[\\displaystyle f'(-3) = 3e^{-3} > 0, \\quad f'(-1) = -e^{-1} < 0, \\quad f'(1) = 3e > 0.\\]\nSo $f'(t)$ is positive on $(-\\infty,-2),(0,\\infty)$ and negative on\n$\\displaystyle(-2,0)$.\n\nTherefore, $f(t)$ is increasing for $t < -2$, $t > 0$ and decreasing for\n$0 < t < 2$."
