If a box is provided, write your final answer there.\nSimplification of answers is not required unless explicitly requested.\n\nTwo points on the surface of the Earth are called antipodal if they are\nat exactly opposite points (for example, the North Pole and South Pole\nare antipodal points). Prove that, at any given moment, there are two\nantipodal points on the equator with exactly the same temperature.\n\nHint: Let $T(\\theta)$ be the temperature, at any given moment, at the\npoint on the equator with longitudinal angle $\\theta$ measured in\nradians, $0 \\leq \\theta \\leq 2\\pi$ (that is, in one complete trip around\nthe equator, $\\theta$ goes from 0 to $2\\pi$) and consider\n$f(\\theta) = T(\\theta + \\pi) - T(\\theta)$",

        "Notice that the function $\\displaystyle T(\\theta)$ is\n$\\displaystyle 2\\pi$ periodic since the equator is shaped like a circle.\nMathematically this in particular means\n\n\\begin{align*}\\displaystyle T(2\\pi) = T(0).\\end{align*}\n\nWe exploit this fact by looking at\n\n\\begin{align*}\\displaystyle f(0) = T(\\pi)-T(0)\\end{align*}\n\nand\n\n\\begin{align*}\n\\displaystyle f(\\pi) &= T(\\pi+\\pi)-T(\\pi) \\\\\n&= T(2\\pi)-T(\\pi) \\\\\n&= T(0)-T(\\pi) \\\\\n&= -f(0).\\end{align*}\n\nAt this point we want to distinguish two cases:\n\n\\textbf{Case 1.} \\emph{f(0) = 0}. Then\n\n\\begin{align*}\\displaystyle 0 = f(0) = T(\\pi)-T(0)\\end{align*} and hence\n$\\displaystyle T(\\pi) = T(0)$, which is what we wanted to show.\n\n\\textbf{Case 2.} \\emph{f(0) $\\neq$ 0}. Then we have that one of\n$\\displaystyle f(0)$ and $\\displaystyle f(\\pi)$ is positive and one is\nnegative. As \\emph{T} is continuous, we have that \\emph{f} is continuous\nand hence we may invoke the intermediate value theorem to see that there\nexists a point $\\displaystyle c \\in (0, \\pi)$ such that\n$\\displaystyle 0 = f(c) = T(c + \\pi) - T(c)$. Thus, we have\n$\\displaystyle T(c + \\pi) = T(c)$ and this completes the proof."

        "There are two key facts to this problem.\n\n1) The function \\emph{T} is periodic (like $\\sin(x)$).\n\n2) We are looking for a root of \\emph{f}.\n\nWhat theorem helps us guarantee the existence of roots? Use it!", 
        "The intermediate value theorem states that if a function is continuous\non $\\displaystyle [a,b]$ and $\\displaystyle f(a) < 0 < f(b)$ or\n$\\displaystyle f(b) < 0 < f(a)$, then there exists a point\n$\\displaystyle c \\in (a,b)$ such that $\\displaystyle f(c) = 0$."
