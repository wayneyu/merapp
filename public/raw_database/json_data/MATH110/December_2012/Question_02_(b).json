        "As suggested in the hint, we will simplify the limit on the left hand\nside of the equal sign. If we just plug in \\emph{2} we get 0/0, so we\nwill have to do some simplifying. Because the numerator and denominator\nare polynomials, factoring is a good first step.\n\nThe denominator is a difference of squares, so we can write:\n\n$\\lim_{x \\to 2} \\frac{x-2}{4-x^2} = \\lim_{x \\to 2}\\frac{2-x}{(2-x)(2+x)}$\n\nCanceling the common terms, and then plugging in the 2 gives:\n\n$\\lim_{x \\to 2}\\frac{1}{2 + x} = \\frac{1}{2 + 2} = \\frac14$\n\nWhich matches the right hand side of the original equation. Thus the\nstatement is true."
