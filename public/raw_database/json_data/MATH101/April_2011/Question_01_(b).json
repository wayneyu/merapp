So define for the\ntime being\n\n\\begin{align*}g(u) = -\\int_2^u \\sqrt{1 + x^3}dx.\\end{align*}\n\nFrom hint 1, we see immediately that $g'(u) = -\\sqrt{1 + u^3}$. We also\nsee that $f(t) = g(t^4)$. Using the chain rule we can then compute that\n\n\\begin{align*}f'(t) = g'(t^4) \\frac{du}{dt} = -\\sqrt{1 + (t^{4})^3}(4t^3) = -4t^3\\sqrt{1 + t^{12}}.\\end{align*}"
