        "If the base of the rectangle measures $2b$, its bottom right vertex is\nlocated at $(b, 0)$. Therefore its top right vertex is located at\n$(b,8-b^2)$ and it follows that its dimensions are $2b$ by $8-b^2$.\nHence its area is $2b(8-b^2)$. How can we maximize the value of this\nexpression?"
