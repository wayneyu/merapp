From the second row we\nsee that x\\_3=0. Let the free parameter be x\\_2. Then from the first row\nwe see that x\\_1=-2x\\_2. Therefore we have a null vector,\n\n\\[\\begin{bmatrix}\n-2\\\\\n1\\\\\n0\n\\end{bmatrix}\\]\n\nand the solution is\n\n\\[\\mathbf{x}=t\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n-2\\\\\n1\\\\\n0\n\\end{bmatrix}.\\]\n\nThere are an infinite number of solutions."

        "Recall that if the matrix has a row of zeros then the corresponding\nvalue in the augmented part of the matrix must be zero or there is no\nsolution."
