        "The function we are trying to differentiate is the composition of four\nfunctions: three $\\tan x$ functions and an $x^2$. Thus we will use the\nchain rule. This means taking the derivative of the outermost $\\tan x$\nfunction and then replacing $x$ with the rest of the function; then\nmultiplying by the deriviative of the next $\\tan x$ and so on, until\neach part of the function has been differentiated.\n\n(Recall that the derivative of $\\tan x$ is $\\sec^2 x$.)\n\n$f'(x) = \\sec^2(\\tan(\\tan(x^2)))\\cdot \\sec^2(\\tan(x^2)) \\cdot \\sec^2(x^2) \\cdot 2x$."
