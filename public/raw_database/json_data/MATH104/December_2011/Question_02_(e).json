        "\\textbf{Local Maxima and Minima}\n\nTo find local maxima and minima, we consider critical points which are\npoints where the derivative is zero or does not exist. In\n\\href{Science:Math_Exam_Resources/Courses/MATH104/December_2011/Question_2_(c)}{part\n(c)}, we got that the critical points were\n\n\\[x=\\pm{1},\\pm\\sqrt{3},\\pm\\sqrt{6}.\\]\n\nIn that same part we got that the function was\n\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\itemsep1pt\\parskip0pt\\parsep0pt\n\\item\n  increasing on $(-\\infty,-\\sqrt{6})\\cup(-1,1)\\cup(\\sqrt{6},\\infty)$\n\\item\n  decreasing on\n  $(-\\sqrt{6},-\\sqrt{3})\\cup(-\\sqrt{3},-1)\\cup(1,\\sqrt{3})\\cup(\\sqrt{3},\\sqrt{6})$.\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\itemsep1pt\\parskip0pt\\parsep0pt\n\\item\n  We can immediately exclude - and as potential maximum or minimum\n  because the function is not even defined there.\n\\item\n  We notice that to the left of \\emph{x=-} the function is increasing\n  and then on the right it is decreasing. Therefore, we have a\n  \\emph{local maximum} at \\emph{x=-}.\n\\item\n  To the left of \\emph{x=-1}, the function is decreasing and then to the\n  right, it is increasing. Therefore \\emph{x=-1} is a \\emph{local\n  minimum}.\n\\item\n  To the left of \\emph{x=1}, the function is increasing and to the right\n  it is decreasing. Therefore \\emph{x=1} is a \\emph{local maximum}.\n\\item\n  To the left of \\emph{x=} the function is decreasing and to the right\n  it is increasing. Therefore \\emph{x=} is a \\emph{local minimum}.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\nTherefore we conclude that we have two local maxima at $x=-\\sqrt{6},1$\nand two local minima at $x=-1,\\sqrt{6}$.\n\n\\textbf{Inflection Points}\n\nTo find inflection points, we consider where the second derivative is\nzero or does not exist. In\n\\href{Science:Math_Exam_Resources/Courses/MATH104/December_2011/Question_2_(d)}{part\n(d)} we got that the second derivative vanished or failed to exist at\n\n\\[x=0,\\pm\\sqrt{3}.\\]\n\nIn that same part we got that the function was\n\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\itemsep1pt\\parskip0pt\\parsep0pt\n\\item\n  concave down on $(-\\infty,-\\sqrt{3})\\cup(0,\\sqrt{3})$ and\n\\item\n  concave up on $(-\\sqrt{3},0)\\cup(\\sqrt{3},\\infty)$.\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\itemsep1pt\\parskip0pt\\parsep0pt\n\\item\n  Like with the max and min test, we immediately exclude\n  $x=\\scriptstyle \\pm\\sqrt{3}$ because these are vertical asymptotes.\n  While the concavity may change on either side of these points, they\n  are not technically defined as inflection points.\n\\item\n  We see that the only point left to test is \\emph{x=0}. We notice that\n  the function is concave up to the left of \\emph{x=0} and concave down\n  to the right. Therefore, we conclude that since the concavity changes\n  across this point, \\emph{x=0}, is an \\emph{inflection point}.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\\textbf{Exact coordinates}\n\nWe are asked to get the coordinates and we sub the \\emph{x} values for\nour maxima, minima, and inflection point into the function to find the\n\\emph{y} values. Therefore we conclude that\n\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\itemsep1pt\\parskip0pt\\parsep0pt\n\\item\n  $\\left(-\\sqrt{6},1-\\frac{4\\sqrt{6}}{3}\\right)$ is a local maxima,\n\\item\n  $\\left(-1,\\frac{1}{2}\\right)$ is a local minima,\n\\item\n  $\\left(1,\\frac{3}{2}\\right)$ is a local maxima,\n\\item\n  $\\left(\\sqrt{6},1+\\frac{4\\sqrt{6}}{3}\\right)$ is a local minima, and\n\\item\n  $\\displaystyle{}(0,1)$ is an inflection point.\n\\end{itemize}"
