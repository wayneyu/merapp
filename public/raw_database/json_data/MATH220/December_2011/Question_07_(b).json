Since the proofs are of a difficulty that you are\nexpected to be able to handle in this course, we present them here for\ncompleteness.}\n\nThis function is clearly surjective since any integer \\emph{n} is the\nimage of the integer 2\\emph{n}. Now the function is not injective since\n\\emph{g(3) = g(2) = 1} (or more generally since g(2\\emph{k}+1) =\ng(2\\emph{k}) = \\emph{k} for any integer \\emph{k})."
