        "We start our induction at \\emph{n} = 1. In that case we have that\n2\\emph{n} - 1 = 1 and so the sum is just 1 alone which is a perfect\nsquare.\n\nWe can check \\emph{n} = 2 if we want as well, in that case 2\\emph{n} - 1\n= 4 - 1 = 3 and so the sum is 1 + 3 = 4 which is the square of 2.\n\nFor \\emph{n} = 3 we have that 1 + 3 + 5 = 9 which is the square of 3; we\nnow see something which seems to be a pattern, that is for \\emph{n} =\n\\emph{k} the sum will end up being the square of the number \\emph{k}.\nAnd so we conjecture that\n\n\\begin{align*}\\displaystyle\n1+3+5+\\ldots + (2n-1) = n^2\\end{align*}\n\nWe have proved above that this is true for \\emph{n} = 1, 2 and 3. We\nwill use induction to prove that is holds for all values of \\emph{n}.\nSince we have the first step(s) done, we now assume that the conjecture\nholds for \\emph{n} = \\emph{k} and we will show that it still holds for\n\\emph{n} = \\emph{k}+1. Indeed\n\n\\begin{align*}\n\\underbrace{1 + 3 +5 +\\ldots + (2k-1)}_{=k^2} + (2(k+1)-1) &= k^2 + (2k+2-1)\\\\\n&= k^2 + 2k + 1\\\\\n&=(k+1)^2\\end{align*}\n\nThis shows that our conjecture is true for \\emph{n} = \\emph{k}+1 and\nthus concludes our proof.", 
        "\\emph{The following proof is not valid for the purpose of this exam\nquestion since it doesn't use induction, but it is of the level of this\ncourse, so we add it here for completeness.}\n\nConsider playing with square pieces of paper, or colouring squares in a\nlined piece of paper. If you look at a \\emph{n} by \\emph{n} square, it\nis made of \\emph{n}\\textsuperscript{2} squares. The next square you can\nbuilt, which will have now \\emph{n}+1 squares on each side will contain\n(\\emph{n}+1)\\textsuperscript{2} squares, but how many squares were added\nto it? Well you need to add a layer on say the right side, so \\emph{n}\nadditional squares and also a layer on the top side, so another \\emph{n}\nadditional squares and now you are also missing one square at the top\nright corner, so yet another square. In total, to go from the square\nwith \\emph{n} little squares on the side to the next one with \\emph{n}+1\nsquares on each side you need to add 2\\emph{n}+1 squares.\n\nSo if we start with 1 square, we need to add 3 squares to get a 2 by 2\nsquares and we need to add 5 squares to that to get a 3 by 3 square and\nwe need to add 7 squares to get a 4 by 4 square and hence if we sum\n$1+3+5+ \\ldots + (2n-1)$ squares we will get a \\emph{n} by \\emph{n}\nsquare. Which is exactly what we wanted to show.", 
        "\\emph{The following proof is not valid for the purpose of this exam\nquestion since it doesn't use induction, but it is of the level of this\ncourse, so we add it here for completeness.}\n\nAnother proof can be obtained by simply playing with the formula that\nsums consecutive integers, that is\n\n\\begin{align*}1+2+3+4+5+6+\\dots + k = \\sum_{i=1}^k i = \\frac{k(k+1)}{2}\\end{align*}\n\nAnd we just use the fact that\n\n\\begin{align*}\n1+3+5+\\dots+(2n-1) &= \\left( 1+2+3+ \\ldots +(2n-1) + (2n) \\right) \\\\\n&\\quad - (2 + 4 + 6 + \\ldots + (2n))\\end{align*} Or if we use sum notations\n\n\\begin{align*}\\sum_{i=1}^n (2i-1) = \\sum_{i=1}^{2n} i - \\sum_{i=1}^n 2i\\end{align*} Now using\nthe formula above we obtain that\n\n\\begin{align*}\\sum_{i=1}^{2n} i = \\frac{2n(2n+1)}{2} = n(2n+1) = 2n^2+n\\end{align*} and\n\n\\begin{align*}\\sum_{i=1}^n 2i = 2\\sum_{i=1}^n i = 2\\frac{n(n+1)}{2} = n(n+1) = n^2+n\\end{align*}\nAnd so\n\n\\begin{align*}\\displaystyle\n1+3+5+\\dots+(2n-1) = (2n^2+n) - (n^2+n)=n^2\\end{align*} which proves that it is a\nperfect square."
