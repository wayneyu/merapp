        "The answer is \\textbf{true}.\n\nSuppose that \\emph{n} has at least two distinct positive divisors\n\\emph{p} and \\emph{q}. Then it has at least 4 prime divisors given by\n$\\displaystyle 1,p,q,pq$. Thus \\emph{n} must only have one prime\ndivisor. Then if $\\displaystyle n = p^{\\alpha}$, then \\emph{n} has\n$\\displaystyle \\alpha +1$ prime divisors. Thus if\n$\\displaystyle \\alpha + 1 = 3$ we have that $\\displaystyle \\alpha = 2$\nwhich is as claimed in the question."
