        "The answer is \\textbf{b = 2}.\n\nThe quickest solution is to note that adding one egg to the basket gives\na multiple of 2,3,4,5 and 6 and is congruent to 1 modulo 7. Since\n$\\displaystyle \\text{lcm}(2,3,4,5,6) = 60$ we are simply looking for\nmultiples of 60 that are congruent to 1 modulo 7. Notice that\n$\\displaystyle 60 \\equiv 4 \\mod{7}$ and\n$\\displaystyle 120 \\equiv 1 \\mod{7}$. Hence the answer is\n$\\displaystyle 120 - 1 = 119$. reducing modulo 13 gives\n$119 \\equiv 2 \\mod{13}$", 
        "The correct answer is \\textbf{b = 2}\n\nThe slower, albeit more constructive way, to solve this is to set up a\nsystem of equations consisting of the following\n\n\\begin{align*}\nn &\\equiv 1 \\mod 2  \\quad n \\equiv 2 \\mod{3} \\quad n \\equiv 3 \\mod{4} \\\\\nn &\\equiv 4 \\mod{5} \\quad n \\equiv 5 \\mod{6} \\quad n \\equiv 0 \\mod{7}  \\end{align*}\n\nNow we just crunch condition by condition. Notice that some of these\nequations are redundant. In fact the cases modulo 2 and modulo 6 can be\nreduced from the cases modulo 4 and from combining the modulo 2 and 3\ncases respectively. Hence we need only consider the equations\n\n\\begin{align*}\nn \\equiv 2 \\mod 3 \\quad n \\equiv 3 \\mod 4 \\quad n \\equiv 4 \\mod 5 \\quad n \\equiv 0 \\mod 7  \\end{align*}\n\nFor the remaining steps, let $\\displaystyle k_{i}$ be integers for each\n$\\displaystyle i=1..4$ as needed. The first equation tells us that\n\n\\begin{align*}\nn = 2 + 3k_{1}\\end{align*}\n\nPlugging into the second yields\n$\\displaystyle 2 + 3k_{1} \\equiv 3 \\mod 4$ which implies that\n$\\displaystyle k_{1} \\equiv 3 \\mod 4$. This says\n$\\displaystyle k_{1} = 3 + 4k_{2}$. Plugging into the equation above\nyields\n\n\\begin{align*}\nn = 2 + 3k_{1} = 2 + 3(3 + 4k_{2}) = 11 + 12k_{2}\\end{align*}\n\nNext, into the third equation yields\n$\\displaystyle 11 + 12k_{2} \\equiv 4 \\mod 5$ which implies that\n$k_{2} \\equiv 4 \\mod 5$. This says $\\displaystyle k_{2} = 4 + 5k_{3}$ .\nHence, plugging into the equation above yields\n\n\\begin{align*}\nn = 11 + 12k_{2} = 11 + 12(4 + 5k_{3}) = 59 + 60k_{3}\\end{align*}\n\nLastly, into the fourth equation yields\n$\\displaystyle 59 + 60k_{3} \\equiv 0 \\mod 7$ which implies that\n$\\displaystyle k_{3} \\equiv 1 \\mod 7$. This says\n$\\displaystyle k_{3} = 1 + 7k_{4}$. Hence, plugging into the equation\nabove yields\n\n\\begin{align*}\n n = 59 + 60k_{3} = 59 + 60(1 + 7k_{4}) = 119 + 420k_{4}\\end{align*}\n\nThus, in order for all these conditions to be satisfied, we need\n\\emph{n} to be congruent to 119 modulo 420. The minimum such number is\n119. Modulo 13, we see that the answer is 2."
