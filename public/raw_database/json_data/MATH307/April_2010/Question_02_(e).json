        "Given in the question is that $\\displaystyle A = SBS^{-1}$\n\nBy definition,\n\n$cond(A) = \\left \\|A \\right \\|\\left \\|A^{-1} \\right \\|$\n\nNote that the condition number of a non-invertible matrix is $\\infty$.\n\nWe can prove that \\emph{A} is not an invertible matrix by looking at the\ndeterminant of the matrix.\n\nProof:\n\n\\begin{align*}\ndet(A) &= det(SBS^{-1})\\\\\n&= det(S)det(B)det(S^{-1})\\\\\n&= det(S)\\frac{1}{det(S)}det(B)\\\\\n&= det(B)\\\\\n&= (1)(1)(0)(-1)(-1)\\\\\n&=0\n\\end{align*}\n\nThus $cond(A) = \\infty$"
