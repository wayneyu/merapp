        "One way to determine the point where the distance between the point P\nand the ellipse are closest is to determine the equation of the normal\nline to the ellipse that passes through the point P.\n\nWe can use implicit differentiation to determine the slope of the\ntangent line at a point (x,y) on the ellipse:\n\n\\begin{align*}\\frac{2x}{9} + 2y\\frac{dy}{dx} = 0 \\quad \\rightarrow \\quad \\frac{dy}{dx} = m = -\\frac{x}{9y}\\end{align*}\nRemember that the slope of the normal line to a function at a point x is\njust the negative reciprocal of the slope at the same point. i.e: if m\nis slope of the tangent line (as above) and M is the slope of the normal\nline, both at a point x, then:\n\n\\begin{align*}M = -\\frac{1}{m} = \\frac{9y}{x}\\end{align*} Therefore the equation for the line\nthat is normal to the ellipse at point (a,b) that passes through the\npoint P on the ellipse is given by\n\n\\begin{align*}(y - 0) = \\frac{9b}{a}(x - 4/9)\\end{align*} Since this normal line will also\npass through the point where the normal line is being taken, we can\nsolve for (a,b) by solving the following:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n(b - 0) &= \\frac{9b}{a}(a - 4/9)\\\\\na &= 9(a - 4/9)\\\\\n8a &= 4 \\quad \\rightarrow \\quad a = \\frac{1}{2}\\end{align*} To figure out the corresponding values of b, we use the\nfact that the point (a,b) must lie on the ellipse:\n\n\\begin{align*}\\frac{a^{2}}{9} + b^{2} = 1 \\quad \\rightarrow \\quad b = \\pm\\frac{\\sqrt{35}}{6}\\end{align*}\nNotice that we have two solutions! Therefore, there are two points on\nthe ellipse that are closest to the point P. The two points are:\n\n\\begin{align*}{\\color{blue}(a,b) = \\left(\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{\\sqrt{35}}{6} \\right), \\, \\left(\\frac{1}{2},-\\frac{\\sqrt{35}}{6}\\right)}\\end{align*}", 
        "This can also be treated as an optimization problem. So, we need to\ndetermine the quantity that we want to optimize. We want to determine\nthe point on the given ellipse, $(x,y)$, that is closest to the point\n$P = (x_{0},y_{0}) = (4/9,0)$.\n\nThus, we want to minimize the distance between the two points which we\nwill denote by, $L$. We obtain an expression for $L$ using the formula\nfor distance between two points:\n\n\\begin{align*}\nL &= \\sqrt{(x - x_{0})^{2} + (y - y_{0})^{2}} \\\\\n&= \\sqrt{\\left(x - \\frac{4}{9}\\right)^{2} + y^{2}}\\end{align*} Our constraint in this problem is that the point $(x,y)$\nmust lie on the ellipse,\n\n\\begin{align*}\\frac{x^{2}}{9} + y^{2} = 1 \\quad \\rightarrow \\quad y^{2} = 1 - \\frac{x^{2}}{9}\\end{align*}\nReplacing $y^{2}$ in our expression for $L$ with what is given by our\nconstraint, we obtain\n\n\\begin{align*}\nL(x) &= \\sqrt{\\left(x - \\frac{4}{9}\\right)^{2} + 1 - \\frac{x^{2}}{9}}.\\end{align*} To minimize $L$, we need to determine the critical points\nof $L$. So we compute $L'$ and set it to zero.\n\n\\begin{align*}\nL'(x) &= \\frac{2(x - 4/9) - 2x/9}{2\\sqrt{\\left(x - 4/9\\right)^{2} + 1 - x^{2}/9}} = \\frac{8x - 4}{9\\sqrt{\\left(x - 4/9\\right)^{2} + 1 - x^{2}/9}} = 0.\\end{align*} The solution to the above equation is x = 1/2. To figure\nout the corresponding value(s) of $y$, we substitute the $x$ value into\nthe equation of the ellipse:\n\n\\begin{align*}y^{2} = 1 - \\frac{1}{36} \\quad \\rightarrow \\quad  y = \\pm\\frac{\\sqrt{35}}{6}.\\end{align*}\nSo there are two critical points on the ellipse:\n\n\\begin{align*}(x,y) = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{\\sqrt{35}}{6} \\right), \\, \\left(\\frac{1}{2}, -\\frac{\\sqrt{35}}{6} \\right)\\end{align*}\nThe distance between each of these points and P is the same:\n\n\\begin{align*}L = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{4}{9}\\right)^{2} + \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{35}}{6}\\right)^{2}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{1}{18^{2}}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{35}{36}\\right)} \\approx 0.988\\end{align*}\nWe also need to consider the distance between P and the left and\nright-most points of the ellipse, which occur at (-3,0) and (3,0).\nComputing value of $L$ for each of these points gives $L$ approximately\nequal to 3.444 and 2.556, respectively. The distances between P and each\nof the two endpoints are both larger than the distance between the first\ntwo points that we found. Therefore, the (x,y) coordinates of the points\nthat minimize the distance between the ellipse and P are:\n\n\\begin{align*}{\\color{blue}(x,y) = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{\\sqrt{35}}{6} \\right), \\, \\left(\\frac{1}{2}, -\\frac{\\sqrt{35}}{6}\\right)}\\end{align*}"
