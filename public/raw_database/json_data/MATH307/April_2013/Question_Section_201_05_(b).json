        "Reading off graph (using -1 indicated opposite direction as shown, +1 to\nindicate same direction as shown) (each row corresponds to an edge)\n\n\\[\\vec{v_1} = \\begin{bmatrix}\n1\\\\0\\\\-1\\\\1\\\\0\\\\-1\\\\0\n\\end{bmatrix}, \\vec{v_2} = \\begin{bmatrix}\n0\\\\-1\\\\0\\\\1\\\\-1\\\\0\\\\1\n\\end{bmatrix}\\]\n\nThese form a complete basis in \\emph{N(D\\textsuperscript{T})} if the\n\\emph{dim(N(D\\textsuperscript{T})) = 2}. So (if \\emph{D} has \\emph{n}\nrows and \\emph{m} columns): \\emph{dim(N(D)) = 1} (\\# of connected\ncircuits). Therefore, \\emph{r(D) = m - dim(N(D)) = 6 - 1 = 5} (by\nRank-Nullity theorem). Also by Rank-Nullity theorem:\n\\emph{dim(N(D\\textsuperscript{T})) = n - r(D) = 7 - 5 = 2} and hence\nthese two loop current vectors form a basis in\n\\emph{N(D\\textsuperscript{T})} and any other loop current can be\nexpressed using a linear combination of these two basis vectors."
