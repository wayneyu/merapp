        "The condition\n\n\\begin{align*}\\displaystyle\nx^2 < 5\\end{align*} is equivalent to the conditions\n\n\\begin{align*}\\displaystyle\n- \\sqrt{5} < x < \\sqrt{5}\\end{align*}\n\nThis means, we can rewrite the set \\emph{M} as being\n\n\\begin{align*}\\displaystyle\nM = \\mathbb{Q} \\cap (-\\sqrt{5},\\sqrt{5})\\end{align*}\n\nThe infimum of a set being the largest real number that is smaller or\nequal to all the numbers of the set, it seems to be a good idea to think\nthat - is a good candidate for the infimum of the set \\emph{M}.\n\nSince -\u00c2~is clearly smaller than all the numbers of the set \\emph{M}, we\nonly need to show that it is the largest real number with that property.\n\nAssume that there is a number \\emph{m} with that property as well, that\nis strictly larger than -, that is\n\n\\begin{align*}m \\leq x \\quad\\text{for all } x \\in M \\quad\\text{and}\\quad m > -\\sqrt{5}\\end{align*}\nWe'll simply show that such a \\emph{m} cannot exist and hence - is the\ninfimum of the set \\emph{M}.\n\nIndeed, if \\emph{m} is strictly larger than - than it means that the\ninterval\n\n\\begin{align*}\\displaystyle\n(-\\sqrt{5} , m)\\end{align*} is not empty. Since non-empty interval of real numbers\ncontain infinitely many numbers, we can find two distinct numbers in\nthat interval $x_1$ and $x_2$, that is\n\n\\begin{align*}\\displaystyle\n-\\sqrt{5} < x_1 < x_2 < m\\end{align*}\n\nNow a property of the rational numbers is that you can always find a\nrational number between any two distinct real numbers. That means there\nmust exist a rational number \\emph{q} between $x_1$ and $x_2$, so we\nhave\n\n\\begin{align*}\\displaystyle\n-\\sqrt{5} < x_1 < q < x_2 < m < \\sqrt{5}\\end{align*} but in particular that means\nthat \\emph{q} is in the interval (-,) and since it is rational, \\emph{q}\nis an element of the set \\emph{M}. But by construction, \\emph{q}\n\\textless{} \\emph{m} which contradicts the assumption that \\emph{m}\ncould be a lower bound of the set \\emph{M}. This means that such a\nnumber \\emph{m} cannot exist and hence the infimum of the set \\emph{M}\nhas to be -."
