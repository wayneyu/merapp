        "In order to estimate $\\ln(1.1)$ we need to find a linear approximation\nof $\\ln(x)$ at some point \\emph{a}. Because I know that $\\ln(1) = 0$ and\n\\emph{1} is close to \\emph{1.1}, \\emph{x = 1} would be a good choice for\n\\emph{a}.\n\nThe linear approximation of $f(x)$ at \\emph{a} is the same as finding\nthe equation of the tangent line to $f(x)$ at \\emph{a}. Our function is\n$f(x) = \\ln x$ and we chose \\emph{a = 1}. We find the slope of the\ntangent line/linear approximation by taking the derivative $f'(x) = 1/x$\nand then calculating $f'(1) = 1$. The tangent line/linear approximation\nruns though the point $(1, f(1))$ or \\emph{(1,0)}.\n\nUsing our slope of \\emph{1} and the point \\emph{(1,0)}, we find the\nequation of the tangent line/linear approximation to be \\emph{L(x) = x -\n1}. To complete the approximation of $\\ln(1.1)$, we plug \\emph{1.1} into\n\\emph{L(x)} to get:\n\n\\[L(1.1) = 1.1 - 1 = 0.1\\]\n\nSo $\\ln(1.1) \\approx 0.1$."
