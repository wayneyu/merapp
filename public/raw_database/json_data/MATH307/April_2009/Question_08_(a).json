    "statement": "A player begins a game of chance by placing a marker in box 2, marked\nstart. A die is rolled, and the marker is moved one square to the left\nif a 1 or 2 is rolled and one square to the right if a 3, 4, 5, or 6 is\nrolled. This process continues until the marker lands in square 1, in\nwhich case the player wins the game, or in square 4, in which case the\nplayer loses the game.\n\n\\textbf{(a)} Write a stochastic matrix that represents the behaviour of\nthe game. Label the columns with the corresponding \u00e2\u0080\u009cstates\u00e2\u0080\u009d of the\ngame.\n\n\\emph{Hint: Once you win, you win forever; and once you lose, you lose\nforever; i.e., if you reach state 1 at some point you will continue to\nstay at state 1 forever-after.}",

        "Since the matrix is stochastic, all columns should sum to 1. We see that\nwe have a 1/3 chance of moving to square 1 and a 2/3 chance of moving to\nsquare 3 from square 2, since the probability of rolling any specific\nnumber on the die is 1/6 and the probabilities are independent, so\n$P(A or B) = P(A)+P(B)$; similarly, we have a 1/3 chance of moving to\nsquare 2 and a 2/3 chance of moving to square 4 from square 3. If we get\nto squares 1 or 4, then we stay there, since the game is over. So let\ncolumn 1 represent the first square of the game, column 2 the second,\ncolumn 3 the third, and column 4 the fourth. Then the stochastic matrix\nrepresenting the behaviour of the game is\n\n\\[\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & \\frac{1}{3} & 0 & 0\\\\ \n0 & 0 & \\frac{1}{3} & 0\\\\ \n0 & \\frac{2}{3} & 0 & 0\\\\ \n0 & 0 & \\frac{2}{3} & 1\n\\end{bmatrix}\\]"
