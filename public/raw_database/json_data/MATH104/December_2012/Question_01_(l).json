        "The fact that $f'(a)$ exists is equivalent to saying that the function\n$f(x)$ is differentiable at $x = a$.\n\nRecall that a function must be continuous at a point to be\ndifferentiable at that point.\n\nFor the function to be continuous at a point $x = a$, the condition\n\n\\begin{align*}\\lim_{x \\rightarrow a}f(x) = f(a)\\end{align*} must be satisfied. Therefore, (i)\nis the answer."
