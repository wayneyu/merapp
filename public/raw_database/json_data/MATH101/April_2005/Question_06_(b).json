    "statement": "A tree trunk is 60 feet long and has circular cross sections. The\ndiameters in feet measured at 10-foot intervals starting at the bottom\nof the tree are 10, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, and 3. The volume of the tree, in\ncubic feet, is computed using the formula\n\n\\[V = \\int_0^{60} A(y)\\,dy,\\]\n\nwhere $A(y)$ is the cross-sectional area of the trunk, in square feet,\n$y$ feet above the bottom of the tree.\n\n(b) It is known that the fourth derivative of $A(y)$ has values that lie\nbetween 3 and 30,000. How many measurements of the tree's diameter\n(equally spaced along the tree trunk) would be needed in order to\nestimate its volume using Simpson's Rule to an accuracy of 1 cubic foot?\nYou may use the fact that the error made in approximating a definite\nintegral $\\int_a^b f(x)\\,dx$ by the corresponding Simpson's Rule\napproximation $S_n$ is at most $(M(b-a)^5)/(180n^4)$, where\n$\\left|f^{(4)}(x)\\right|\\leq M$ on the interval $[a,b]$.\n\nYou must give your answer as explicit integer for full marks.",

        "If the error associated with Simpson's rule is bounded by 1, then we\nwould get that the approximation is precise to 1 cubic foot. Hence we\ncompute when\n\n\\[\\frac{M(b-a)^5}{180n^4} = \\frac{30000(60-0)^{5}}{180n^{4}} \\leq 1\\]\n\nSolving and using {[}prime{]} factorization techniques, we have\n\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{30000(60-0)^{5}}{180n^{4}} &\\leq 1 \\\\\n\\frac{3\\cdot 10^{4}\\cdot3^{5}\\cdot2^{5}\\cdot 10^{5}}{2\\cdot3^{2}\\cdot10} &\\leq n^{4} \\\\\n\\frac{ 3^{6}\\cdot2^{5}\\cdot 10^{9}}{2\\cdot3^{2}\\cdot10} &\\leq n^{4} \\\\\n3^{4}\\cdot2^{4}\\cdot 10^{8} &\\leq n^{4} \\\\\n3\\cdot2\\cdot 10^{2} &\\leq n \\\\\n600 &\\leq n \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\nThus \\emph{n} should be at least 600."
