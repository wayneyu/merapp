        "It is clear that this function is continuous and differentiable\neverywhere, except maybe at \\emph{x = 1}.\n\nLet's start with checking continuity. For \\emph{f(x)} to be continuous\nat \\emph{x = 1} the left and right limits of the function must be the\nsame. Hence we set\n\n\\begin{align*}\n\\lim_{x \\to 1^-} f(x) &= \\lim_{x \\to 1^+} f(x) \\\\\n\\lim_{x \\to 1} -x^2 &= \\lim_{x \\to 1} ax^3 + bx - 2\n\\end{align*}\n\nBecause these functions are polynomials we can simply substitute the\nx-value to get:\n\n\\begin{align*} \n-(1)^2 &= a(1)^3 + b(1) - 2 \\\\\n-1 &= a + b - 2\n\\end{align*}\n\nThis gives us one equation in terms of \\emph{a} and \\emph{b}. We can't\nproceed any further with this equation right now, so we will turn to the\nsecond condition that the function be differentiable. This means that\nthe derivatives from the right and left of \\emph{x = 1} must be equal.\nIn other words:\n\n\\[\\displaystyle (-x^2)' = (ax^3 + bx -2)'\\] at $\\displaystyle x = 1$\n\n\\[\\displaystyle -2x = 3ax^2 + b\\] at $\\displaystyle x = 1$\n\nPlugging in \\emph{x = 1} this yields\n\n\\[\\displaystyle -2(1) = 3a(1)^2 + b\\]\n\n\\[\\displaystyle -2 = 3a+ b\\]\n\nwhich gives another equation in terms of \\emph{a} and \\emph{b}.\n\nWe know both equations must hold if $f(x)$ is to be continuous and\ndifferentiable, so we can solve them as a system of equations to find\n\\emph{a} and \\emph{b}. Solving the first equation for \\emph{b} we get:\n\n\\[\\displaystyle b = 1 - a\\]\n\nSubstituting this into the second equation we get:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n-2 &= 3a + 1 - a \\\\\n-3 &= 2a \\\\\n\\frac{-3}{2} &= a \\end{align*}\n\nPlugging this back into $b = 1 - a$ we get that $b = \\frac{5}{2}$.\n\n(Note that the system of equations can be solved multiple ways - using a\ndifferent substitution or elimination would also work.)\n\nSo $a = -\\frac32$ and $b = \\frac52$ are values that satisfy the\nconditions that $f(x)$ be continuous and differentiable."

        "A function is continuous at a point \\emph{x = a} if its limits from both\nsides of \\emph{a} exist and the value of these limits agrees with\n$f(a)$.\n\nFurthermore, the function is differentiable at \\emph{a} if the\nderivatives from both sides of \\emph{a} exist and agree at \\emph{a}."
