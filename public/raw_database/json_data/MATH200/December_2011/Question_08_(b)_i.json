        "Region (1) is part of head or body?\n\nIn the integral (1), spherical coordinates are used, where the radius\ncovers the interval $\\displaystyle \\rho\\in[0,2]$, the horizontal angle\ncovers $\\displaystyle \\theta\\in[0,2\\pi]$ which is the whole circle and\nthe vertical angle covers $\\displaystyle \\phi\\in[0,2/3\\pi]$. Hence, the\nregion of integration is a ball with radius $\\displaystyle 2$, where a\ncone is cut out from below.\n\nSince the head of the snowman is a ball with radius $\\displaystyle 2$,\nthis region must be part of the head.\n\n Finding the equation of the enclosing sphere\n\nSince the region of integration is part of the ball with radius\n$\\displaystyle 2$, whose centre is in the origin, it is enclosed by the\nsphere $\\displaystyle x^2+y^2+z^2 = 2^2 =4$.\n\n Finding the equation of the enclosing cone\n\nIt is left to find the equation of the cone which is cut out from the\nregion of integration. The cone is defined through the angle\n$\\displaystyle \\phi$, as seen in the following figure, which shows a\ncross-section of the region of integration through the\n$\\displaystyle zy$-plane.\n\n\\begin{description}\n\\itemsep1pt\\parskip0pt\\parsep0pt\n\\item[]\n\\includegraphics[width=.5\\textwidth]{Math200Dec11Q8bi.jpg}\n\\end{description}\n\nTo find the equation of the cone, we must rewrite the expression\n$\\displaystyle \\phi=\\frac23\\pi$ into cartesian coordinates. The\nrelationship between spherical and cartesian coordinates is\n\n\\begin{align*}\nx&=\\rho\\cos(\\theta)\\sin(\\phi)\\\\\ny&=\\rho\\sin(\\theta)\\sin(\\phi)\\\\\nz&=\\rho\\cos(\\phi)\\end{align*}\n\nwhere $\\displaystyle \\rho = \\sqrt{x^2+y^2+z^2}$. Pluging in\n$\\displaystyle \\phi = \\frac23\\pi$ gives for $\\displaystyle z$\n\n\\begin{align*}\n z&=\\rho \\cos\\left(\\frac23\\pi\\right) = -\\frac12\\rho = -\\frac12\\sqrt{x^2+y^2+z^2}\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\ z^2 &= \\frac14(x^2+y^2+z^2)\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\ 4z^2 &= x^2+y^2+z^2\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\ 3z^2 &= x^2+y^2\\end{align*}\n\nwhich is the required cone equation."

        "Consider the upper and lower limits of the variables of integration.\nAccording to the size and shape of the region of integration, in\nparticular $\\displaystyle \\rho \\in[0,2]$, you can identify it with the\nhead or body of the snowman.", 
        "Once you found that the region of integration (1) is part of the head,\nthe sphere enclosing the region must be the sphere equation of the head.\n\nTo find the cone-equation of the cone, which is cut out from the sphere,\nthe angle $\\displaystyle \\phi = \\frac23\\pi$ is important. Rewrite the\nexpression $\\displaystyle \\phi = \\frac23\\pi$ from spherical coordinates\ninto the equivalent expression in cartesian coordinates."
