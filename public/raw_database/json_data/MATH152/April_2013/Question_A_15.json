        "(b) and (d) are the only correct statements independent of $A$ and $B$.\n\n(a) Recall that scaling a row is an elementary row operation which\nscales the determinant by the same factor, so if the determinant of $A$\nis non-zero, $\\displaystyle \\det A = \\det B$ can fail to hold.\n\n(b) All elementary row operations can be represented by invertible\nmatrices, so since $B$ is a product of these matrices, if $B$ is\ninvertible, then so is $A$. Alternatively, recall that elementary row\noperations can only scale the determinant of a matrix by a non-zero\nfactor. Thus, if $\\displaystyle \\det B$ is non-zero (i.e. it is\ninvertible) then $\\displaystyle \\det A$ is non-zero (so is invertible as\nwell).\n\n(c) This is false, elementary row operations do change eigenvectors. For\na simple example, let $A = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}$\nand $B = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}$. Subtracting the\nfirst row from the second row reduces \\emph{B} to \\emph{A}. However,\n$\\displaystyle Av = v$, so \\emph{v} is an eigenvector of \\emph{A}, while\n\n\\[Bv = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}\\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix}\\]\nwhich is not a multiple of \\emph{v}. Hence \\emph{v} is not an\neigenvector of \\emph{B}.\n\n(d) If $\\displaystyle \\lambda=0$ is an eigenvalue of \\emph{A}, then\n\\emph{A} is not invertible and the determinant of \\emph{A} is 0. As in\n(b), elementary row operations only scale the determinant by a constant\nnon-zero factor. Therefore, the\n$\\displaystyle \\det(B) = c(\\det(A)) = c(0) = 0$ and hence \\emph{B} is\nnot invertible. Hence $\\displaystyle \\lambda=0$ is also an eigenvalue\nof \\emph{B}.\n\nAlternatively, applying an elementary row operation can be represented\nby multiplication of the original matrix by an elementary matrix (which\nis invertible). Suppose $\\displaystyle B = EA$. Then if\n$\\displaystyle Av = 0$, we have $\\displaystyle Bv = E(Av) = E(0) = 0$,\nso 0 is an eigenvalue for $\\displaystyle B$ as well (in this case,\n\\emph{v} is also an eigenvector for this special eigenvalue)."

        "A matrix is invertible if its determinant is non-zero. Can elementary\nrow operations transform a matrix that had a non-zero determinant to a\nmatrix with determinant zero?", 
        "Eigenvectors are very specific to a matrix. Multiplying a matrix\n\\emph{A} with \\emph{e\\textsubscript{1}} returns the first column of\n\\emph{A}. That is, if \\emph{aj} is the \\emph{j}-th column of \\emph{A},\n\n\\[A = \\begin{bmatrix}\na_1 & | & a_2 & | & \\dots & | & a_n\n\\end{bmatrix}\\]\n\nthen\n\n\\[Ae_1 = \\begin{bmatrix}\na_1 & | & a_2 & | & \\dots & | & a_n\n\\end{bmatrix}e_1 = a_1\\]\n\nSince \\emph{v = e\\textsubscript{1}} is an eigenvector of the matrix\n\\emph{A} we know that\n\n\\begin{align*}\nAv &= \\lambda v \\\\\nAe_1 &= \\lambda e_1 = \\begin{bmatrix} \\lambda \\\\ 0 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix}\n\\end{align*}\n\nHence \\emph{a\\textsubscript{1} = \u03bb e\\textsubscript{1}}. In other words,\nthe only non-zero entry of the first column of \\emph{A} is in the first\nrow. Can you perform elementary row operations to move that entry into\nanother row, and hence find a counter example?"
