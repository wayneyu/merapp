        "We use the method of washers.\n\nFor any \\emph{x} in \\emph{(-1,2)}, the larger and smaller radii \\emph{R}\nand \\emph{r} of the washer is given by\n\n\\[R(x) = 5-(x+1) = 4-x \\,\\]\n\n\\[r(x) = 5-(4-(x-1)^2) = 1+(x-1)^2 \\,\\] (The simplifications given above\nare not really necessary)\n\nNotice that the larger radius \\emph{R} is given by the distance from the\naxis of revolution \\emph{y=5} to the lower curve, because it is further\naway.\n\nTherefore, the area of the washer is\n\n\\[A(x) = (R^2 - r^2)\\pi = \\left[(4-x)^2 - \\left(1+(x-1)^2\\right)^2\\right]\\pi\\]\n\nNow we can write down the integral that represents the volume of the\nsolid of revolution:\n\n\\begin{align*}\nV &= \\int_{-1}^2 A(x) dx \\\\\n&= \\pi \\left[\\int_{-1}^2 (4-x)^2 - \\left(1+(x-1)^2\\right)^2 dx \\right]\\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\n\\textbf{According to the question statement, we may stop here.}\n\n\\emph{If you are interested to find the value of the integral, read on.}\n\nTo solve this integral, we split it in two parts and write\n\n\\[V =  \\pi \\left[ \\int_{-1}^2 (4-x)^2 dx - \\int_{-1}^2 \\left(1+(x-1)^2\\right)^2 dx \\right]\\]\n\nWe refrain from expanding the brackets but make a change of variables\n\\emph{u=4-x, du=-dx} and \\emph{v=x-1, dv=dx} for the first and second\nintegral respectively. Not forgetting to update the integration limits,\nwe arrive at\n\n\\begin{align*}\nV &= \\pi \\left[\\int_{-1}^2 (4-x)^2 dx - \\int_{-1}^2 \\left(1+(x-1)^2\\right)^2 dx \\right]\\\\\n&= \\pi \\left[\\int_5^2 u^2 (-du) - \\int_{-2}^1 \\left(1+v^2\\right)^2 dv \\right]\\\\\n&= \\pi \\left[\\int_2^5 u^2 du - \\int_{-2}^1 \\left(1+2v^2+v^4\\right) dv \\right]\\\\\n&= \\pi \\left( \\left[u^3/3\\right]^5_2 - \\left[v+2v^3/3+v^5/5\\right]_{-2}^1 \\right)\\\\\n&= \\pi \\left( (125-8)/3 -\\left[3+2(1+8)/3+(1+32)/5\\right] \\right)\\\\\n&= \\pi \\left( 39 - 3 - 6 - 6 - 3/5 \\right)\\\\\n&= \\pi \\left( 24 - 3/5 \\right) = 117\\pi / 5\\\\\n\\end{align*}"

        "Use the method of washers (cross-sections).\n\nLook at the sketch at part a), the cross-sections are formed by\nintersecting the region \\emph{R} by a straight line \\emph{x=c} where\n\\emph{-1\\textless{}c\\textless{}2}, and then rotating the line segment\nabout the axis \\emph{y=5}. The result should look like a washer.\n\nTo find the volume of revolution, find the area of this washer as a\nfunction of \\emph{x} and then integrate from the left to right endpoint\nof the region."
