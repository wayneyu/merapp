Find the populations of\nManitoba and Alberta, given that the populations are in a steady state\n(meaning that they don$^{\\prime}$t change from year to year)",

        "Given that we are in steady state, and with the transition matrix M =\n$\\begin{bmatrix}\n0.9 & 0.07 & 0.06\\\\\n0.05 & 0.91 & 0.07\\\\\n0.05 & 0.02 & 0.87\n\\end{bmatrix}$, we have that Ms = s.Reworking this a bit, we get: Ms = s Ms - s = 0 (M - 1)s = 0 (M - I)s =\n0\n\nSolving for the null space of (M - I), we get our steady state vector s\n= $\\begin{bmatrix}\n\n0.6700\\\\\n\n0.6505\\\\\n\n0.3578\n\n\\end{bmatrix}$Given that the population of BC is 1 million, we need to multiply by\n1,000,000/0.6505 to get our final population vector. This turns out to\nbe:\n\n1,000,000/0.6505 * s = $\\begin{bmatrix}\n\n1,030,000\\\\\n\n1,000,000\\\\\n\n550,000\n\n\\end{bmatrix}$\n\nSo the population of Manitoba is 550,000, and the population of Alberta\nis 1,030,000."
