Let $\\Delta$ be the\ntriangle whose vertices are \\emph{A},\\emph{B}, and \\emph{C}.\n\nFind the plane \\emph{P} containing $\\Delta$ in the equation form i.e. in\nthe form\n\n\\begin{align*}\\displaystyle\nax + by + cz = d\\end{align*}\n\nwith \\emph{a},\\emph{b},\\emph{c} and \\emph{d} specified.",

        "Since the points A, B, and C all lie in the plane P, we have the\nfollowing equations are satisfied:\n\n\\begin{align*}\nb + 2c &= d \\\\\na + 3c &= d \\\\\na + b + 4c &= d\\end{align*}. Writing these equations as a linear system gives\n\n\\begin{align*}\\begin{bmatrix}\n0 & 1 & 2 & -1 \\\\\n1 & 0 & 3 & -1 \\\\\n1 & 1 & 4 & -1 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\begin{bmatrix}\na \\\\\nb \\\\\nc \\\\\nd\n\\end{bmatrix}\n= \\mathbf{0}\\end{align*} Row reducing this system such that we have a pivot in\neach row we get:\n\n\\begin{align*}\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 0 & 0 & 2 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 1 & -1 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\begin{bmatrix}\na \\\\\nb \\\\\nc \\\\\nd\n\\end{bmatrix}\n= \\mathbf{0} \\quad \\rightarrow \\quad a = -2d,\\,b = -d,\\,c = d\\end{align*} So we\ncan see that we have one free parameter. In other words, any specific\nvalues of a,b, and c are determined by our choice of d. If we choose d =\n1, then a = -2, b = -1, c = 1. Hence, the plane defined by the points\nA,B and C is ${\\color{blue}-2x -y + z = 1}.$\n\n(Note that any constant multiple the planar equation is also a correct\nanswer: e.g. $\\displaystyle 4x + 2y - 2z = -2.$ )"
