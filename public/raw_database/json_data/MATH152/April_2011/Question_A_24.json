        "From the hint we see that a probability equilibrium vector gives us the\nprobabilities of a final state from any initial state. This means that\nonce we transition to a certain point, further transitions do not impact\nthe probability any more. Let's assume we have reached this special\nequilibrium vector \\textbf{v} then\n\n\\begin{align*}P\\mathbf{v}=\\mathbf{v}\\end{align*}\n\nwhich says exactly what we stated; attempting to transition \\textbf{v}\ndoes nothing to it. Therefore the special vector \\textbf{v}, will\nsatisfy\n\n\\begin{align*}\n(P-I)\\mathbf{v}&=\\mathbf{0}\\\\\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n-2/10  &  3/10  &  1/10\\\\\n2/10  &  -7/10  &  7/10\\\\\n0  &  4/10  &  -8/10\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\begin{bmatrix}\nv_1\\\\\nv_2\\\\\nv_3\n\\end{bmatrix}\n&=\\begin{bmatrix}\n0\\\\\n0\\\\\n0\n\\end{bmatrix}\\end{align*}\n\nwhich we can solve (using Gaussian elimination) to get, for a free\nparameter, t,\n\n\\begin{align*}\\mathbf{v}=\\left[\\frac{7}{2}t,2t,t\\right].\\end{align*}\n\nNow recall that the input vector \\textbf{v} is a set of probabilities\nand so the entries of \\textbf{v} must sum to 1. Therefore we have that,\n\n\\begin{align*}v_1+v_2+v_3=\\frac{7}{2}t+2t+t=\\frac{13}{2}t=1\\end{align*}\n\nand therefore, t=2/13 so that our equilibrium vector \\textbf{v} is\n\n\\begin{align*}\\mathbf{v}=\\left[\\frac{7}{13},\\frac{4}{13},\\frac{2}{13}\\right].\\end{align*}\n\n\\textbf{\\emph{Note}} \\emph{(This is not necessary to answer the\nquestion):} Our result means that starting from any initial state, we\nwill end up in state 1 with a probability of 7/13, state 2 with a\nprobability of 4/13 and state 3 with a probability of 2/13. If we try\nthis with our initial state from\n\\href{Science:Math_Exam_Resources/Courses/MATH152/April_2011/Question_A23}{A\n23}, {[}0,1,0{]} we notice that after 8 transitions,\n\n\\begin{align*}\\displaystyle{}P^8[0,1,0]=[0.5309904100,0.3114556300,0.1575539600]\\end{align*}\n\nwhere our equilibrium vector is\n\n\\begin{align*}\\mathbf{v}=[0.5384615385,0.3076923077,0.1538461538]\\end{align*}\n\nwhich is already a fairly good agreement!\n\n\\textbf{\\emph{Note further:}} It may have crossed some minds that the\nequilibrium vector is always the eigenvector for the transition matrix\ncorresponding to an eigenvalue of 1, whose entries sum to 1. For\nprobability matrices where the columns sum to 1 there will always be\nsuch a vector."
