        "From our answer in\n\\href{Science:Math_Exam_Resources/Courses/MATH200/April_2012/Question_05_(a)}{part\n(a)}, we found that there were two critical points of the objective\nfunction,\n\n\\begin{align*}\\displaystyle \\Lambda(x,y,z) = f(x,y,z) + \\mu(x + y + z - 2) + \\nu(x^{2} + y^{2} + z^{2} - 2),\\end{align*}\non \\emph{C}. Those critical points corresponded to the critical points\nof the function \\emph{$f$(x,y,z) = z} restricted to the curve \\emph{C}.\nThe values of \\emph{z} corresponding to those critical points were\n\\emph{z = 0} and \\emph{z = 4/3}. In contrast to\n\\href{Science:Math_Exam_Resources/Courses/MATH200/April_2012/Question_05_(a)}{part\n(a)} where we looked for the larger of the two, we are now interested in\nthe smaller value \\emph{z = 0}.\n\nTo find the corresponding \\emph{x} and \\emph{y} value, recall the\ncondition \\emph{x = y} from\n\\href{Science:Math_Exam_Resources/Courses/MATH200/April_2012/Question_05_(a)}{part\n(a)}. Plugging this into the equation for the line, we obtain\n\n\\begin{align*}x + x + 0 = 2 \\quad \\rightarrow \\quad x = y = 1\\end{align*}\n\nTherefore, the lowest point on \\emph{C} is (1,1,0)."

        "Consider that ``height'' in this case is referring the value of the\n\\emph{z} coordinate. In\n\\href{Science:Math_Exam_Resources/Courses/MATH200/April_2012/Question_05_(a)}{part\n(a)}, we were trying to find the maximum value of \\emph{z} (i.e. the\nmaximum height) on \\emph{C}. How can we use our answer from\n\\href{Science:Math_Exam_Resources/Courses/MATH200/April_2012/Question_05_(a)}{part\n(a)} to answer this question?"
