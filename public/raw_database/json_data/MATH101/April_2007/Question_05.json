Justify your answers and show all your work.\nSimplification of answers is not required.\n\n\\includegraphics[width=.5\\textwidth]{MATH101Apr2007Q5Statement1.png} A paper cup has the\nshape depicted below. All of its horizontal cross sections are circles;\nthe radius of the cup's bottom is 3 cm and the radius of its top is 6\ncm. The cup is full of Cona Cola, which has a density of 1000\nkg/$m^{3}$. The Cona Cola is drunk through a vertical straw that extends\n10 cm above the top of the cup and reaches the bottom of the cup.\nExpress as an explicit definite integral the work performed in drinking\nall the cola. Do not evaluate this integral. For the acceleration due to\ngravity, use the value $9.8 m/s^{2}$.",

        "Our first step will be to extend the cup to look like a cone and label\neverything as shown in the diagram.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htbp]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=.5\\textwidth]{ConaCola.jpg}\n\\caption{ConaCola.jpg}\n\\end{figure}\n\nNow, we can compute the value of \\emph{y} quickly via similar triangles\n(the big triangle and the one with side length 3),\n\n\\begin{align*}\\frac{20+y}{6} = \\frac{y}{3}\\end{align*}\n\nand this gives \\emph{y} = 20cm. However, notice in the question that\nthere are several different units everywhere and so for consistency we\nshould use a single unit (metres). As shown, let $x_{i}^{*}$ be a sample\npoint between 0 and 0.2 (0 to 20cm), measured from the top of the cup.\nThen, at this point, the radius, labeled as $r_{i}$ is\n\n\\begin{align*}\\frac{r_{i}}{0.4-x_{i}^{*}} = \\frac{0.06}{0.4} = \\frac{3}{20}\\end{align*}\n\nand isolating gives\n\n\\begin{align*}r_{i} = \\frac{3(0.4-x_{i}^{*})}{20} = \\frac{1.2-3x_{i}^{*}}{20}\\end{align*}\n\nNow, using the volume of a cylinder formula, we have\n\n\\begin{align*}V_{i} = \\pi r_{i}^{2} \\Delta x = \\pi \\bigg( \\frac{1.2-3x_{i}^{*}}{20}\\bigg)^2 \\Delta x\\end{align*}\n\nUsing the mass formula with $\\delta$ as density, we have\n\n\\begin{align*}m_{i} = \\delta V_{i} = 1000\\pi \\bigg( \\frac{1.2-3x_{i}^{*}}{20}\\bigg)^2 \\Delta x\\end{align*}\n\nUsing the force formula, we have\n\n\\begin{align*}F_{i} = m_{i} g = (9.8)1000\\pi \\bigg( \\frac{1.2-3x_{i}^{*}}{20}\\bigg)^2 \\Delta x\\end{align*}\n\nand finally, using the work formula, we can compute that the work done\nat the sample point is\n\n\\begin{align*}W_{i} = F_{i} d = (9.8)1000\\pi \\bigg( \\frac{1.2-3x_{i}^{*}}{20}\\bigg)^2 \\Delta x (0.1 + x_{i}^{*})\\end{align*}\n\nwhere we added 0.1m (10cm) to the distance \\emph{d} above since we are\nusing a straw that is 10 cm above the cup. Hence, summing all these\npieces gives\n\n\\begin{align*}\n\\lim_{n \\to \\infty}\\sum_{i=1}^{n} W_{i} &= \\lim_{n \\to \\infty}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}(9.8)1000\\pi \\bigg( \\frac{1.2-3x_{i}^{*}}{20}\\bigg)^2 \\Delta x (0.1 + x_{i}^{*}) \\\\\n&= \\int_{0}^{20} (9.8)1000\\pi \\bigg( \\frac{1.2-3x}{20}\\bigg)^2(0.1 + x)  \\, dx \\end{align*}\n\ncompleting the question (we do not need to evaluate this integral)."
