        "Using the linear approximation formula\n\n$f(x) \\approx f'(a)(x - a) + f(a)$\n\nwhere our function is $f(x) = \\sqrt{x}$ and our value of \\emph{a} will\nbe a number near 48. Choosing \\emph{a = 49} is sensible because you can\ntake the square root easily. We can either calculate\n$\\displaystyle f'(x)$ again or note that we already found it in\n\\href{Science:Math_Exam_Resources/Courses/MATH102/December_2012/Question_C_2}{question\nC2} as $f'(x) = 1/(2\\sqrt{x})$. Plugging all this in gives:\n\n$f(x) \\approx \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{49}}(x - 49) + \\sqrt{49} = \\frac1{14}(x - 49) + 7$\n\nTo approximate $b = \\sqrt{48}$, we say\n\n$\\sqrt{48} = f(48) \\approx  \\frac1{14}(48 - 49) + 7 = \\frac{-1}{14} + 7 = 6\\frac{13}{14}$\n\nWhether the linear approximation is an over or under estimate depends on\nthe concavity of the function - if $f(x)$ is concave up, the tangent\nline approximation lies below the graph and is an under-estimate; the\nopposite is true if $f(x)$ is concave down. Because $f(x) = \\sqrt{x}$ is\nconcave down, our estimate in this problem is an over-estimate."
