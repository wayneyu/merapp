    "statement": "The following discrete dynamical system describes the yearly migration\nof wild horse populations among three areas R, G, and B. Let\n\\emph{r(t)}, \\emph{g(t)}, and \\emph{b(t)} be the sizes of the horse\npopulation in areas R, G, and B respectively at the\n\\emph{t\\textsuperscript{th}} year.\n\n\\begin{align*}\nx(t+1) &= \\begin{bmatrix} r(t+1) \\\\ g(t+1) \\\\ b(t+1) \\end{bmatrix} \\\\\n&= \\begin{bmatrix} r(t)/2 + g(t)/3 + b(t)/3 \\\\\nr(t)/2 + g(t)/3 + b(t)/2 \\\\\ng(t)/3 + b(t)/6\n\\end{bmatrix} \\\\\n&= \\begin{bmatrix} 1/2 & 1/3 & 1/3 \\\\ 1/2 & 1/3 & 1/2 \\\\ 0 & 1/3 & 1/6 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} r(t) \\\\ g(t) \\\\ b(t) \\end{bmatrix} \\\\\n&= Ax(t)\n\\end{align*}\n\nWhere the Markov matrix \\emph{A} describes how the horses move among\nthese areas from one year to the next. The 1st column indicates that\neach year 1/2 of the horses in area R remain in area R and 1/2 will\nmigrate to area G. The 2nd column shows that horses in area G will be\nevenly distributed in the three areas one year later. The 3rd column\nimplies that, of the horses in area B, 1/3 will migrate to area R, 1/2\nwill migrate to area G, and only 1/6 will remain in area B.\n\nWe assume that no horses are lost and no new horses are added and that\ninitially (i.e. at \\emph{t = 0}), there are a total of 350 horses all\nlocated in area B. Thus $\\vec x(0) = [0\\ 0\\ 350]^T$.\n\n\\textbf{(a)} Show that \\emph{\u03bb\\textsubscript{3} = 1} is an eigenvalue of\n\\emph{A}. Then, find the other two eigenvalues \\emph{\u03bb\\textsubscript{1}}\nand \\emph{\u03bb\\textsubscript{2}}.",

        "The eigenvalues are given by the formula\n\n$det(A-\\lambda * I) = \\left| \\begin{array}{ccc}\na_{1 1} - \\lambda & a_{1 2} & a_{1 3} \\\\\na_{2 1} & a_{2 2} - \\lambda & a_{2 3} \\\\\na_{3 1} & a_{3 2} & a_{3 3} - \\lambda \\end{array} \\right| = 0$\n\nDoing this gives the following polynomial\n\n$-\\lambda^{3}+\\lambda^2+\\frac{1}{36}\\lambda-\\frac{1}{36} = 0$\n\nThe values we get are $\\lambda = 1,\\frac{1}{6},\\frac{-1}{6}$\n\nThese are the eigenvalues of Matrix A and it shows that 1 is an\neigenvalue"
