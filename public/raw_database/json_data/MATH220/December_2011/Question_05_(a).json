        "A set \\emph{A} is denumerable if it is in bijective correspondence with\nthe natural numbers. That is, it is denumerable if and only if there\nexists a bijective function\n\n\\[\\displaystyle\nf: A \\to \\mathbb{N}\\]\n\n\\textbf{Note:} Mathematicians think of this function as a\n\\emph{counting} of all the elements of the set \\emph{A}. Given a\ncounting, that is such a bijection $f$ the \\emph{first} element of the set\n\\emph{A} is the one that is mapped to 1 by the function, the\n\\emph{second} element is the one mapped to 2 and so on. Observe that we\nneed to require the function to be bijective to guarantee that all the\nelements are counted and are counted in a unique way (we don't want to\nhave two elements mapped to the same natural number)."
