        "Following the hint, we compute the inverse of 7 modulo 13. Then\n\n\\begin{align*}\n13 &= 7(1) + 6\\\\\n7 &= 6(1) + 1\n\\end{align*}\n\nand back substituting gives\n$\\displaystyle 1 = 7 -6(1) = 7 - (13-7(1)) = 7(2) - 13$.\n\nThus, the inverse of 7 modulo 13 is 2. Hence\n$\\displaystyle x \\equiv 2(7)x \\equiv 2(4) \\equiv 8 \\mod{13}$ which\ncompletes the question."
