A can have at the most n pivot\ncolumns, i.e. rank(A) = n and AB can have at the most n pivot columns,\nhence rank(AB) $\\leq$ rank(A).\n\nLikewise, since R(AB) is also contained in the the subspace R(A) , the\neasiest way to see this is if given vector y if\n\n$\\vec{y} = (AB)\\vec{x}$\n\nthen\n\n$\\vec{y} = A(B\\vec{x})$\n\nhence the rank of AB is contained in the rank of A"
