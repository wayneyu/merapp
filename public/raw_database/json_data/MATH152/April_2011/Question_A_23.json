        "We are starting in state 2 so there is 100\\% probability of starting in\nstate 2 and zero elsewhere, therefore our input vector is\n\n\\[\\mathbf{x}=\\left[0,1,0\\right].\\]\n\nIf we wanted to know the probabilities for moving one transition we\nwould compute \\textbf{t\\textsubscript{1}} = \\emph{P\\textbf{x}},\n\n\\[\\mathbf{t}_1=P\\mathbf{x}=\\begin{bmatrix}\n8/10  &  3/10  &  1/10\\\\\n2/10  &  3/10  &  7/10\\\\\n0  &  4/10  &  2/10\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n0\\\\\n1\\\\\n0\n\\end{bmatrix}\n=\\begin{bmatrix}\n3/10\\\\\n3/10\\\\\n4/10\n\\end{bmatrix}.\\]\n\nHowever we want to know the probabilities for a second transition. We\ncan think of this as a first transition of our new vector\n\\textbf{t\\textsubscript{1}}. Therefore the second transition\nprobabilities are \\textbf{t\\textsubscript{1}} = \\emph{P}\n\\textbf{t\\textsubscript{1}},\n\n\\[\\mathbf{t}_2=P\\mathbf{t}_1=\\begin{bmatrix}\n8/10  &  3/10  &  1/10\\\\\n2/10  &  3/10  &  7/10\\\\\n0  &  4/10  &  2/10\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n3/10\\\\\n3/10\\\\\n4/10\n\\end{bmatrix}\n=\\begin{bmatrix}\n37/100\\\\\n43/100\\\\\n20/100\n\\end{bmatrix}.\\]\n\nTherefore, starting in state 2, it is \\textbf{most likely that after two\ntransitions, the person will still be in state 2} since 43/100 is the\nhighest of the three probabilities.\n\nNotice, we could also think of the problem as,\n\n\\[\\mathbf{t}_2=P\\mathbf{t}_1=P(P\\mathbf{x})=P^2\\mathbf{x}\\]\n\nso that if we wanted the \\emph{n}\\textsuperscript{th} transition\nprobabilities we'd have \\textbf{t\\textsubscript{n}} =\n\\emph{P\\textsuperscript{n}} \\textbf{x}."
