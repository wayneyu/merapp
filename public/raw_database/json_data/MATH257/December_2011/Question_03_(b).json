        "In short, the Fourier convergence theorem states the following.\n\nIf $f$ is a periodic function such that $f$ and $\\displaystyle {}f'$ are\npiecewise continuous, then the Fouriner series converges to $f(x)$ at\nall points where $f$ is continuous and converges to\n$\\frac{1}{2} [f(x+) + f(x-)]$ at all points where $f$ is discontinuous.\n\nIn the above, $f(x+)$ denotes the right hand limit of $f$ at $x$, while\n$f(x-)$ denotes the left hand limit of $f$ at $x$. In other words, for a\nreal number $a$,\n\n\\begin{align*}f(a+) = \\lim_{x \\to a^+} f(x) \\;\\; \\text{and} \\;\\; f(a-) = \\lim_{x \\to a^-} f(x).\\end{align*}\\\\With\nthe Fourier convergence theorem in mind, let's find out the point of\nconvergence of the Fourier cosine series $Cf(x)$ at each point $x$ in\nthe interval $[0,1]$. To do so, we first need to understand the origin\nof the Fourier cosine series. Recall that the Fourier cosine series is\nthe Fourier series of $f_{\\text{even}}$ where $f_{\\text{even}}$ is the\neven extension of $f$. Following the Fourier convergence theorem, to\nfind the point of convergence of the Fourier cosine series, we need to\nknow where the points of continuity and discontinuity of\n$f_{\\text{even}}$ are. We will do so by sketching the graph of\n$f_{\\text{even}}$. To begin, we sketch the graph of $f(x)$.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htbp]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=.5\\textwidth]{Math_Exam_Resources_Courses_MATH257_December_2011_Question_3_(b)_q3b_1.png}\n\\caption{A sketch of $f(x)$}\n\\end{figure}\n\nThe graph of $f_{\\text{even}}$ is obtained by first reflecting $f$ over\nthe y-axis and hence obtaining a function over the interval $[-1,1]$. We\nthen periodic extend this function to get $f_{\\text{even}}$ which will\nhave a period of $2$.\n\n\\includegraphics[width=.5\\textwidth]{Math_Exam_Resources_Courses_MATH257_December_2011_Question_3_(b)_q3b_2.png}\\\\From\nthe sketch of $f_{\\text{even}}$, we see that $f_{\\text{even}}$ is\ncontinuous everywhere. Hence, by the Fourier convergence theorem, the\nFourier cosine series $Cf(x)$ converges to $f_{\\text{even}}$ for every\nreal number $x$. Now, since $f$ agrees with $f_{\\text{even}}$ at every\npoint in the interval $[0,1]$,\n\n\\begin{description}\n\\itemsep1pt\\parskip0pt\\parsep0pt\n\\item[]\n\\textbf{$Cf(x)$ converges to $f(x) = x$ at every point $x$ in the\ninterval $[0,1]$}.\n\\end{description}\n\nSimilarly, let $f_{\\text{odd}}$ be the odd extension of $f$. Then the\nFourier sine series $Sf(x)$ is the Fourier series of $f_{\\text{odd}}$.\nWe will sketch $f_{\\text{odd}}$ to find its points of continuity and\ndiscontinuity.\n\nThe graph of $f_{\\text{odd}}$ is obtained by first rotating $f$ about\nthe origin by 180 degree and hence obtaining a function over the\ninterval $[-1,1]$. We then periodic extend this function to get\n$f_{\\text{odd}}$ which will have a period of $2$.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htbp]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=.5\\textwidth]{Math_Exam_Resources_Courses_MATH257_December_2011_Question_3_(b)_q3b_3.png}\n\\caption{A sketch of the odd extension of $f(x)$. The part of the\nfunction from $-1$ to $1$ is coloured in red. The red part shows one\nperiod of $f_{\\text{odd}}$.The values at points of discontinuity is not\nspecified in the sketch.}\n\\end{figure}\n\nFrom the sketch of $f_{\\text{odd}}$ is discontinuous at points\n$x = -1+2k$ with k an integer. Hence, by the Fourier convergence\ntheorem, the Fourier sine series $Sf$ converges to $f_{\\text{odd}}$ at\nevery point in the interval $[0,1{\\color{red})}$, but at $x = 1$, $Sf$\nconverges to\n\n\\begin{align*}\\frac{1}{2}[f_{\\text{odd}}(1-)  + f_{\\text{odd}}(1+) ] = \\frac{1}{2}[1  + (-1) ] = 0.\\end{align*}\nSince $f_{\\text{odd}}$ agrees with $f$ in the interval $[0,1)$,\n\n\\begin{description}\n\\itemsep1pt\\parskip0pt\\parsep0pt\n\\item[]\n\\emph{' $Sf(x)$ converges to $f(x) = x$ at every point in the interval\n$[0,1{\\color{red})}$ and at $x =1$, $Sf(1)$ converges to 0}'.\\end{description}\n\nFinally, the question asks us to verify our conclusions for the Fourier\nsine series at x = 0 and x = 1. Evaluate the sine series found at part a\nat $x = 0$, we get\n\n\\begin{align*}Sf(0) = \\sum_{n =1}^\\infty \\frac{2}{n \\pi} (-1)^{n+1} \\underbrace{\\sin(n \\pi \\; 0)}_{=0}  = \\sum_{n =1}^\\infty 0  = 0\\end{align*}\nand evaluating at $x = 1$, we get\n\n\\begin{align*}Sf(1) = \\sum_{n =1}^\\infty \\frac{2}{n \\pi} (-1)^{n+1} \\underbrace{\\sin(n \\pi)}_{=0}  = \\sum_{n =1}^\\infty 0  = 0\\end{align*}\nas expected."

        "The reason we want to sketch both the odd and even extensions of $f(x)$\nis because the Fourier sine series comes from the odd extension of\n$f(x)$, while the Fourier cosine series comes from the even extension of\n$f(x)$."
