        "\\textbf{False:} The easiest way to see this is to come up with a\nfunction where the limit exists but the function is not defined there.\nFor example $f(x) = \\frac{4(x-1)}{x-1}$. The limit exists and is equal\nto $4$ but $1$ is not in the domain, so $f(1)$ is not defined. Hence the\nstatement is \\textbf{false}."

        "The key observation in this problem is to note that the function\n$\\displaystyle f(x)$ is not necessarily continuous! Try to find a\ncounter example where the function is not continuous."
