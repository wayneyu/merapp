    "statement": "A paper cup has the unusual shape depicted below. All of its horizontal\ncross sections are squares, with the top of the cup a square of side\nlength 6 cm and the cup has a height of 10 cm. The cup is initially full\nof Jolting Java, a potent coffee drink. The precious liquid is leaking\nfrom a small hole at the bottom of the cup. After 10 minutes, the height\nof the coffee above the bottom of the cup has decreased from 10 cm to 5\ncm. After how many more minutes will the cup be completely empty? Assume\nthe coffeee drains according to Toricelli's Law, which is stated below.\nHere, \\emph{y} is the height of the top surface of the coffee above the\nbottom of the cup, \\emph{A}(\\emph{y}) is the area of the horizontal\ncross-section of the cup at height \\emph{y} above the bottom, and\n\\emph{k} is a positive constant. (Also, assume that no coffee is drunk\nor lost to evaporation.)\n\n\\textbf{Toricelli's Law:}\n\n\\[A(y)\\frac{dy}{dt} = k\\sqrt{y}\\]\n\n\\begin{figure}[htbp]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=.5\\textwidth]{Math_Exam_Resources_Courses_MATH101_April_2008_Question_6_picture_1.png}\n\\caption{Math\\_Exam\\_Resources\\_Courses\\_MATH101\\_April\\_2008\\_Question\\_6\\_picture\\_1.png}\n\\end{figure}",

        "We will follow the strategy suggested in the hints above.\n\n\\textbf{Step 1.} First, we compute \\emph{A}(\\emph{y}). If you look at\nthe cup from the side, you can see a triangle with a base of 6 and a\nheight of 10. The coffee level is a subtriangle (that is similar one) at\nheight \\emph{y} and base length say \\emph{b}(\\emph{y}). Since these are\nsimilar triangles, we obtain that\n\n\\[\\frac{y}{b(y)} = \\frac{10}{6}\\]\n\nAnd so the area at height \\emph{y} is\n\n\\[A(y) = (b(y))^2 = \\left(\\frac{6y}{10}\\right)^2 = \\frac{9y^2}{25}\\]\n\n\\textbf{Step 2.} Now, we can rewrite Toricelli's Law and go at solving\nthe differential equation:\n\n\\[A(y) \\frac{dy}{dt} = k \\sqrt{y}\\] becomes\n\n\\[\\frac{9y^2}{25} \\frac{dy}{dt} = k \\sqrt{y}\\] We rearrange the terms to\nobtain\n\n\\[\\frac{9y^{3/2}}{25} \\frac{dy}{dt} = k\\] and we integrate with respect\nof \\emph{t}\n\n\\[\\int \\frac{9y^{3/2}}{25} \\frac{dy}{dt}\\,dt = \\int k\\,dt\\] On the left\nside, it is a change of variable, so we can integrate with respect to\n\\emph{y}\n\n\\[\\int \\frac{9y^{3/2}}{25} \\,dy = \\int k\\,dt\\] And now, computing each\nintegral separately, we obtain the equation:\n\n\\[\\frac{9}{25}\\frac{2}{5}y^{5/2} = kt+c\\] for some constant \\emph{c} to\ndetermine. Rearranging the equation to write it as a function of\n\\emph{y} we obtain\n\n\\[y(t) = \\left( \\frac{125}{18}(kt+c) \\right)^{2/5}\\]\n\n\\textbf{Step 3.} Now, we can use the given information, that can be\ndescribed as:\n\n\\[y(0)=10 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad y(10)=5\\] The first one yields:\n\n\\[10 = \\left( \\frac{125}{18}(0+c) \\right)^{2/5}\\] And rearranging we can\nsolve for \\emph{c} and find:\n\n\\[c = \\frac{18}{125}10^{5/2}\\] This allows us to rewrite the function\nfor \\emph{y} as:\n\n\\[y(t) = \\left( \\frac{125}{18}kt+10^{5/2} \\right)^{2/5}\\]\n\n\\emph{(We all would love to have that 10 come out with the powers that\nlook like they would nicely simplify, but this is \\textbf{really not}\npossible, so we continue.)}\n\nNow, the second information \\emph{y(10) = 5} will allow us to compute\nthe value of \\emph{k}\n\n\\[5 = \\left( \\frac{125}{18}10k+10^{5/2} \\right)^{2/5}\\] We do the\nalgebra and get\n\n\\begin{align*}\nk &= \\frac{18(5^{5/2}-10^{5/2})}{(10)(125)} = \\frac{9(5^{5/2}-(2^{5/2})(5^{5/2}))}{5(5^3)} \\\\\n&= 9\\cdot 5^{-3/2}(1-2^{5/2})\n\\end{align*} ''(Yes, it is a negative number, but it does make a lot of\nsense, since we expect \\emph{dy}/\\emph{dt} to be negative.)''\n\nAnd so we have finally solved the differential equation and have now a\n``beautiful'' expression for \\emph{y}(\\emph{t}) (after doing a little\nalgebra to simplify it):\n\n\\[y(t) = \\left( \\frac{5^{3/2}}{2}(1-2^{5/2})t+10^{5/2} \\right)^{2/5}\\]\n\n\\textbf{Step 4.} And we can solve the problem which is just to find\nwhich value of \\emph{t} yields \\emph{y}=0, so we just have to solve the\nequation:\n\n\\[0 = \\left( \\frac{5^{3/2}}{2}(1-2^{5/2})t+10^{5/2} \\right)^{2/5}\\] And\nby raising to the power 5/2\n\n\\[0 = \\frac{5^{3/2}}{2}(1-2^{5/2})t+10^{5/2}\\] And obtain\n\n\\[t = - \\frac{10^{5/2}}{\\frac{5^{3/2}}{2}(1-2^{5/2})} = \\frac{5 \\cdot 2^{7/2}}{2^{5/2}-1} = \\frac{40 \\sqrt{2}}{4\\sqrt{2}-1}\\]\nThis last answer is as good as you can get without a calculator (you\nwon't have one in the exam). Stopping anywhere earlier would work too,\nso if your simplification skills aren't great, it isn't a worry here,\nthough it might make your life really hard earlier in the problem.\n\nAnd since you asked gently, the numerical value of that thing is around\n12.147, which makes a bunch of sense given the way \\emph{y} decrease."
