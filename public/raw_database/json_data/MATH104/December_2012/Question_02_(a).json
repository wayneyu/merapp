        "Since we are given the derivative, it is easy to see that the values of\nthe derivative where it is equal to zero or undefined.\n\nThe derivative is equal to zero where $x=0$ and where $x^{2} - 9 = 0$,\nso at $x = \\pm 3$. The derivative is undefined where $x^{2}-3 = 0$ so at\nthe points $x = \\pm \\sqrt{3}$.\n\nNotice that the derivative's denominator is always positive since it is\na positive number times a square. So when checking for sign changes, we\nneed only to look at the derivative's numerator, that is, the function\n$\\displaystyle 2x^{2}(x^{2}-9)$ (note we could check the denominator as\nwell, but this trick saves a lot of valuable time on an exam!). Let's\nlook at each interval individually.\n\n\\textbf{Case 1\\[(-\\infty,-3)\\]}\n\nOn this interval, we have that at the point $x=-4$ that the numerator is\n$\\displaystyle 2(-4)^{2}((-4)^{2}-9) = 224 > 0$ and so the function is\nincreasing on this interval.\n\n\\textbf{Case 2\\[(-3,-\\sqrt{3})\\]}\n\nOn this interval, we have that at the point $x=-2$ that the numerator is\n$\\displaystyle 2(-2)^{2}((-2)^{2}-9) = -40 < 0$ and so the function is\ndecreasing on this interval.\n\n\\textbf{Case 3\\[(-\\sqrt{3},0)\\]}\n\nOn this interval, we have that at the point $x=-1$ that the numerator is\n$\\displaystyle 2(-1)^{2}((-1)^{2}-9) = -16 < 0$ and so the function is\ndecreasing on this interval.\n\n\\textbf{Case 4\\[(0,\\sqrt{3})\\]}\n\nOn this interval, we have that at the point $x=1$ that the numerator is\n$\\displaystyle 2(1)^{2}((1)^{2}-9) = -16 < 0$ and so the function is\ndecreasing on this interval.\n\n\\textbf{Case 5\\[(\\sqrt{3},3)\\]}\n\nOn this interval, we have that at the point $x=2$ that the numerator is\n$\\displaystyle 2(2)^{2}((2)^{2}-9) = -40 < 0$ and so the function is\ndecreasing on this interval.\n\n\\textbf{Case 6\\[(3,\\infty)\\]}\n\nOn this interval, we have that at the point $x=4$ that the numerator is\n$\\displaystyle 2(4)^{2}((4)^{2}-9) = 224 > 0$ and so the function is\nincreasing on this interval.\n\nThis completes the problem."

        "Remember that to find intervals of increase and decrease, we need to\ncheck all the intervals between points where the derivative is undefined\nand where the derivative is zero. Find these values and check points\nbetween all these intervals."
