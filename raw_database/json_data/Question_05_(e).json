        "From parts (a) and (d), we know that the critical values for the first\nand second derivative of $f(x)$ are $x = -1, x = 0$, and $x = 4$. We\nfirst calculate the corresponding y-values for the x-values named above\n...\n\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\itemsep1pt\\parskip0pt\\parsep0pt\n\\item\n  $\\displaystyle x = -1$,\n  $\\displaystyle y = f(-1) = 6(-1)^{1/5} + (-1)^{6/5} = -6 + 1 = -5$\n\\item\n  $\\displaystyle  x = 0$,\n  $\\displaystyle y = f(0) = 6(0)^{1/5} + (0)^{6/5} = 0$\n\\item\n  $\\displaystyle  x = 4$,\n  $\\displaystyle  y = f(4) = 6(4)^{1/5} + (4)^{6/5} \\approx 13.2$\n\\end{itemize}\n\n...and then plot these points on the graph.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htbp]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics{Math ExamResourcesCoursesMATH100December 2011Question 05 (e)Solution 1a.jpg}\n\\caption{Math ExamResourcesCoursesMATH100December 2011Question 05 (e)Solution 1a.jpg}\n\\end{figure}\n\nFrom part (b), we know the function is decreasing until the point\n$(-1, -5)$ and then increasing. Thus the function has a minimum at that\npoint. Because the derivative is undefined at $(0,0)$, it has a vertical\ntangent line there.\n\nSchematically, the tangent lines and increase/decrease of the function\nlooks like this.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htbp]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics{Math ExamResourcesCoursesMATH100December 2011Question 05 (e)Solution 1b.jpg}\n\\caption{Math ExamResourcesCoursesMATH100December 2011Question 05 (e)Solution 1b.jpg}\n\\end{figure}\n\nHowever, we know the function isn't made up of straight lines - it's\nmore curvy than that. From part (d) we know that the function has an\ninflection point at $x = 0$ and $x = 4$. Furthermore we know that the\nfunction is concave up for $x < 0$ and $x > 4$ and is concave down for\n$0 < x < 4$. This tells us what our curves should look like.\n\nIf we superimpose the curve on top of the straight lines it looks\nsomething like this:\n\n\\begin{figure}[htbp]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics{Math ExamResourcesCoursesMATH100December 2011Question 05 (e)Solution 1c.jpg}\n\\caption{Math ExamResourcesCoursesMATH100December 2011Question 05 (e)Solution 1c.jpg}\n\\end{figure}\n\nSo the final graph should look like this:\n\n\\begin{figure}[htbp]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics{Math ExamResourcesCoursesMATH100December 2011Question 05 (e)Solution 1d-002.jpg}\n\\caption{Math ExamResourcesCoursesMATH100December 2011Question 05 (e)Solution 1d-002.jpg}\n\\end{figure}"

        "A vertical tangent line means that the derivative is undefined at the\npoint. As for the sketch, use the previous parts of this question to\nhelp with your drawing."
