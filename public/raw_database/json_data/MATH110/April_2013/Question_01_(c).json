        "The statement is \\textbf{false}.\n\nA minimum always occurs at a critical point - however, there are two\npossible reasons for a critical point: either $\\displaystyle f'(x) = 0$\n\\textbf{or} $\\displaystyle f'(x)$ does not exist. In this second case,\nthe derivative is not equal to zero, but there can still be a local\nminimum. For example, the derivative does not exist if there is a cusp\n(sharp corner), a vertical tangent or the function is discontinuous; an\nexample of a cusp is given below:\n\n\\begin{figure}[htbp]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=.5\\textwidth]{MER_Math_110_April_2013_1c_solution.png}\n\\caption{MER Math 110 April 2013 1c solution.png}\n\\end{figure}\n\nIn this case there is a minimum at \\emph{x = 1} but\n$\\displaystyle f'(x)$ does not exist, so it can't be equal to zero. So\nwe found a counter example and hence the statement is \\textbf{false}."
