        "For a plane parallel to $3x - y + 4z = 13$, we can take its normal\nvector to be $<3,-1,4>$ (two parallel planes have normal vectors that\nare scalar multiples of each other and we can just as well choose their\nnormal vectors to be identical).\n\nThus, the plane we seek has equation\n$3(x-x_0) + (-1)(y-y_0) + 4(z-z_0) = 0$ where $(x_0, y_0, z_0)$ is any\npoint on the plane. We are told the plane passes through $(2,1,-1)$ so\nwe take $x_0 = 2$, $y_0 = 1$, and $z_0 = -1$ and the plane's equation\nis:\n\n$3(x-2) - (y-1) + 4(z-(-1)) = 0$ or equivalently, $3x - y + 4z = 1$."
