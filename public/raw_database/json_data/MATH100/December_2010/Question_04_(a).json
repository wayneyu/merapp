        "To have continuity we need that:\n\n{[}1{]} The function f(x) is defined at x = 1.\n\n{[}2{]} $\\lim_{x \\rightarrow 1}f(x)$ exists and is equal to f(1).\n\nClearly we can evaluate $f(1) = \\frac{4}{\\pi}\\tan^{-1}(1) = 1$. So f(1)\nis defined and {[}1{]} is satisfied.\n\nTo check condition 2), we need to evaluate the limit as x goes to 1 of\nf(x), but since the function is piecewise defined, we need to evaluate\nthe left and right-hand limits and confirm that they are equal.\n\n\\begin{align*}\n\\lim_{x \\to 1^{-}}f(x) &= \\lim_{x \\to 1}\\left(\\frac{4}{\\pi}\\tan^{-1}(x)\\right) = \\frac4{\\pi} \\tan^{-1}(1) = 1 \\\\\n\\lim_{x \\to 1^{+}}f(x) &= \\lim_{x \\to 1}\\left(2 - x^{4}\\right) = 2-(1)^4 = 1\\end{align*} From this we can see the left and right-hand limits are\nequal and that they equal f(1), so {[}2{]} is also satisfied. Thus f(x)\nis continuous at x = 1."
