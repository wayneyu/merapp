        "To solve this question, the question itself hints that we should be\nthinking as \\emph{x} as a function of \\emph{y}.\n\n\\begin{align*}x = 100+2y^{3/2} ~\\end{align*}\n\nNow, $\\frac{dx}{dy}=2(3/2)y^{3/2-1}=3 \\sqrt{y}$\\\\Thus, the length is\ngiven by\n\n$\\int_0^{11} \\sqrt{1+(3 \\sqrt{y})^{2}} \\,dy =  \\int_0^{11} \\sqrt{1+9y} \\,dy$\n\nLet $u = 1 + 9y$ so that $du = 9dy$. Changing the endpoints gives\n$u(0) = 1 + 9(0) = 1$ and $u(11) = 1 + 9(11) = 100$. Thus,\n\n\\begin{align*}\n\\int_0^{11} \\sqrt{1+(3 \\sqrt{y})^{2}} \\,dy &=  \\int_0^{11} \\sqrt{1+9y} \\,dy \\\\\n&=  \\frac{1}{9}\\int_1^{100} \\sqrt{u} \\,du \\\\\n&=  \\frac{1}{9}\\left(2u^{3/2}/3\\right)\\Bigr|_{1}^{100} \\\\\n&=  \\frac{2}{27}\\left(u^{3/2}\\right)\\Bigr|_{1}^{100} \\\\\n&=  \\frac{2}{27}(100^{3/2} - 1^{3/2}) \\\\\n&=  \\frac{2}{27}(10^{3} - 1) \\\\\n&=  \\frac{2}{27}(999) \\\\\n&=  74\\end{align*}"

        "For this problem, the look of the problem should tell you that you\nshould try to think about the arc length formula but with the roles of\n\\emph{x} and \\emph{y} switched. That is, think of \\emph{x} as a function\nof \\emph{y} (instead of the usual thinking of \\emph{y} as a function of\n\\emph{x}).", 
        "In the setting of the first hint, the length of this curve is equal to\n\n$\\int_a^b \\sqrt{1+\\left(\\frac{dx}{dy}\\right)^2} dy$\n\nfor some values of $a$ and $b$.", 
        "A final substitution should take you to an easy to evaluate integral and\nthus the final answer."
