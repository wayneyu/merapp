        "The graph of a function is concave down where its second derivative is\nnegative. We are given the function\n\n\\[\\displaystyle\nf(x) = 2x^4 - 4x^3 - 9x^2 - x + 3\\] Its derivative is\n\n\\[\\displaystyle\nf'(x) = 8x^3 - 12x^2 - 18x - 1\\] and its second derivative is\n\n\\[\\displaystyle\nf''(x) = 24x^2 - 24x - 18 = 6(4x^2-4x-3)\\]\n\nWe need to know the sign of the second derivative, so we find the roots\nof the polynomial 4\\emph{x}\\textsuperscript{2} - 4\\emph{x} -3. Its\ndiscriminant is \u0394 = 16 - 4*4*(-3) = 64 and so its roots are (4 + 8)/8 =\n3/2 and (4-8)/8 = -1/2.\n\nSince \\emph{y} = 4\\emph{x}\\textsuperscript{2} - 4\\emph{x} -3 is a\nconcave up parabola, we know it will be negative on the interval (-1/2,\n3/2) and positive elsewhere and hence the curve \\emph{y} =\n2\\emph{x}\\textsuperscript{4} - 4\\emph{x}\\textsuperscript{3} -\n9\\emph{x}\\textsuperscript{2} - \\emph{x} + 3 will be concave down on that\nsame interval."
