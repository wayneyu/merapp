        "First we see the line\n\n\\texttt{~A=zeros(4,4);}\n\nfrom the hint we notice that Matlab stores by row then by column so this\nis an instruction to create a matrix filled with \\textbf{zeros} that has\n\\textbf{4} rows and \\textbf{4} columns. Therefore after this call we\nhave\n\n\\[A=\\begin{bmatrix}\n0  &  0  &  0  &  0\\\\\n0  &  0  &  0  &  0\\\\\n0  &  0  &  0  &  0\\\\\n0  &  0  &  0  &  0\n\\end{bmatrix}.\\]\n\nThe next lines\n\n\\texttt{~for~k=1:4}\\\\\\texttt{~~~A(k,k)=-k;}\\\\\\texttt{~end}\n\ninitiates a for loop or a counting loop over a variable k. It says to\nstart at k=1, perform whatever is inside the loop, increase k by 1 and\nthen repeat until k=4. Here we see that the \\textbf{k}th row and the\n\\textbf{k}th column of A from 1 $\\leq$ \\textbf{k} $\\leq$ 4 is filled\nwith \\textbf{-k}. Therefore, after this for loop we have\n\n\\[A=\\begin{bmatrix}\n-1  &  0  &  0  &  0\\\\\n0  &  -2  &  0  &  0\\\\\n0  &  0  &  -3  &  0\\\\\n0  &  0  &  0  &  -4\n\\end{bmatrix}.\\]\n\nThe next lines are\n\n\\texttt{~for~k=1:4}\\\\\\texttt{~~~A(1,k)=1;}\\\\\\texttt{~end}\n\nwhich is another for loop. This time we always stay on row \\textbf{1}\nbut column \\textbf{k} gets filled with \\textbf{1} for 1 $\\leq$\n\\textbf{k} $\\leq$ 4. Notice since we still start at k=1 then the first\nentry we write to is A(1,1) which already has a -1 in it. Therefore,\nthis will get overwritten with a 1. The matrix becomes\n\n\\[A=\\begin{bmatrix}\n1  &  1  &  1  &  1\\\\\n0  &  -2  &  0  &  0\\\\\n0  &  0  &  -3  &  0\\\\\n0  &  0  &  0  &  -4\n\\end{bmatrix}.\\]\n\nSince there are no more lines of code, this is the final matrix."
