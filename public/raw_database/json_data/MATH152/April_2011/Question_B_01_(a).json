    "statement": "Three identical fields of size one hectare are planted with different\namounts of three kinds of wheat (types 1, 2 and 3). The first field is\ndivided in three equal parts with one type of wheat planted on each\npart. It yields 12 tons of total harvest. The second field is divided in\ntwo equal parts with type 2 planted on one part and type 3 planted on\nthe other. It yields 10 tons. The third field is divided in two equal\nparts with type 1 planted on one part and type 2 on the other. It yields\n16 tons.\n\nLet\n\n\\begin{align*}\\mathbf{x}=\n\\begin{bmatrix}\nx_1\\\\\nx_2\\\\\nx_3\n\\end{bmatrix}\\end{align*}\n\nbe the vector of unknowns, where $x_k$ is the yield in tons per hectare\nof wheat type \\emph{k}. Describe the information above as as a linear\nsystem in the form\n\n\\begin{align*}A\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{b}\\end{align*}\n\n(write A and \\textbf{b} with specific values).",

        "We have measured the total \\textbf{output} in tons. In a linear system\nsense, this would be the vector \\textbf{b}. How do we relate this output\nto the \\textbf{input} or \\textbf{unknowns}, which in this case is the\ntotal amount of yield per hectare for each wheat type. This would be the\nvector \\textbf{x} in A\\textbf{x}=\\textbf{b}. If we consider a unit\nanalysis we have to multiply \\textbf{x} which is in tons per hectare by\nsomething that results in tons. Therefore, the entries of the matrix A\nmust be hectares. We know that for the first field, a third of the area\ngoes to each type of wheat. Since each field has a total area of 1\nhectare, we know that the area taken up by each wheat in the first field\nis 1/3 hectare. Therefore we know that\n\n\\begin{align*}\\frac{1}{3}x_1+\\frac{1}{3}x_2+\\frac{1}{3}x_3=12\\end{align*}\n\nsince the total output is 12 tons. Similarly, for the second field we\nhave that a half hectare is for type two and a half for type 3.\nTherefore we get a second equation\n\n\\begin{align*}0x_1+\\frac{1}{2}x_2+\\frac{1}{2}x_3=10.\\end{align*}\n\nFinally for the last field we have that a half hectare is for type 1\nwheat and a half hectare for type two. Therefore,\n\n\\begin{align*}\\frac{1}{2}x_1+\\frac{1}{2}x_2+0x_3=16.\\end{align*}\n\nNotice we have three linear equations and thus we have a linear system.\nAs mentioned above, we store the areas in the matrix A, the wheat type\nunknowns are our \\textbf{x} and the resulting output is our \\textbf{b}.\nTherefore we have\n\n\\begin{align*}\nA\\mathbf{x}&=\\mathbf{b}\\\\\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n\\frac{1}{3}  &  \\frac{1}{3}  &  \\frac{1}{3}\\\\\\\\\n0  &  \\frac{1}{2}  &  \\frac{1}{2}\\\\\\\\\n\\frac{1}{2}  &  \\frac{1}{2}  &  0\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\begin{bmatrix}\nx_1\\\\\nx_2\\\\\nx_3\\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n&=\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n12\\\\\n10\\\\\n16\n\\end{bmatrix}\\end{align*}"
