Give explicit\nfunctions $f(x)$, satisfying the conditions above, that yield these\nsmallest and largest values.",

        "The minimum is given by $g(x) = 2x$ and the maximum is given by\n\n$h(x) = \\begin{cases} 6x-x^{2} & \\quad x \\leq 2 \\\\\n8 & \\quad 2 \\leq x \\leq 4 \n\\end{cases}$\n\nTo show that $g(x)$ is the minimum, we note that our $f(x)$ is a\nnondecreasing function, $f(0) = 0$ and we also require that\n$2x \\leq f(x)$. This last condition means that the absolute smallest\n$f(x)$ can be is $f(x) = 2x$ and it turns out that this function also\nhas the first two desired properties so this function works and is\nminimal.\n\nFor the second function, we note that our $f(x)$ is a nondecreasing\nfunction; we also have $f(4) = 8$ and lastly that $f(x)\\leq 6x-x^{2}$.\nAgain to make the function maximal and nondecreasing, we really would\nlike $f(x) = 8$ however this breaks the upper bound condition. So we\npick the function $6x-x^{2}$ until we reach the value of 8 and then pick\nthe function $f(x) = 8$ until the end where we also need to hope that\n$8 \\leq 6x-x^{2}$ on this interval (so that we are not breaking the\nupper bound condition. Let $y = 6x-x^{2}$. Notice that\n\n$y' = 6-2x > 0$ when $x < 3$.\n\nThis means that the function is non-decreasing until $x=3$. Furthermore,\nnotice that\n\n$8 = 6x-x^{2}$ when $0 = x^{2}-6x+8 = (x-2)(x-4)$ and so this occurs\nwhen $x=2$ and $x=  4$. Notice that since this is a parabola, it has\nonly one critical point (which we computed to be at $x=3$ and so indeed\nbetween $2 \\leq x \\leq 4$, we have that\n\n$8 \\leq 6x-x^{2}$.\n\nThus, the function $h(x)$ chosen above has the desired properties we\nrequire and thus gives the maximum value for \\emph{I}. Computing these\nvalues\n\n$\\int_{0}^{4}g(x)\\, dx = \\int_{0}^{4}2x\\,dx = x^{2} |_{0}^{4} = 16$\n\nand\n\n$\\int_{0}^{4}h(x)\\, dx = \\int_{0}^{2}6x-x^{2}\\,dx + \\int_{2}^{4}8\\,dx = \\left.\\left(3x^{2} -\\frac{x^{3}}{3} \\right)\\right|_{0}^{2} + 16 = 12 - \\frac{8}{3} + 16 = \\frac{76}{3}$\n\ncompleting the question."
