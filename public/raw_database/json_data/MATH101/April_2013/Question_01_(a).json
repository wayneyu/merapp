First notice that\n\n$\\displaystyle \\Delta x = (6-2)/4 = 1.$\n\nNext, notice that\n\n\\begin{align*}\nx_{0} &= 2 + 0\\Delta x = 2\\\\\nx_{1} &= 2 + 1\\Delta x = 3\\\\\n...&\\\\\nx_{4} &= 2 + 4\\Delta x = 6 \n\\end{align*}\n\nThus, figuring out the $f(x_{i})$ terms directly from the graph, we have\n\n$T_4 = \\frac12[3+(2)(8)+(2)(7)+(2)(6)+4] = \\frac{49}2$"
