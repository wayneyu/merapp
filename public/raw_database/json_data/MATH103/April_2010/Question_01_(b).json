        "We want to integrate\n\n\\[\\int x^2e^{2x}dx\\] with integration by parts. We have three possible\nproducts:\n\na) $1\\cdot x^2e^{2x}$\n\nb) $x\\cdot xe^{2x}$\n\nc) $x^2\\cdot e^{2x}$\n\nThe first product doesn't make sense to choose since the second term is\nneither easy to derivate nor to integrate.\n\nThe second product also doesn't make sense because the second term is\nnot easy to integrate. Also choosing $xe^{2x}$ as $u$ and $x$ as $dv$ is\nnot good since integrating $x$ AND derivating $xe^{2x}$ makes the\nequation more complicated.\n\nSo it must be the third product. It doesn't matter, if we choose\n$e^{2x}$ as $u$ or $dv$ because the integral is the same (excapt for\nconstants). If we choose $x^2$ as $dv$, we get $x^3/3$ as $v$, what\nmakes the equation more complicated. So we take $x^2$ as $u$ and get\n$du=2x$ and $e^{2x}$ $dv$ and get $v=e^{2x}/2$. That simplified the\nequation. \\textbf{So we take answer ii.}\n\nIntegration would work now like this:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n\\int x^2e^{2x}dx =& \\frac12 x^2e^{2x} - \\int 2x\\frac12 e^{2x}dx\\\\\n =& \\frac12 x^2e^{2x} - \\underbrace{\\int xe^{2x}dx}_{\\text{integrate by parts again}}\\\\\n =& \\frac12 x^2e^{2x} - \\frac12 xe^{2x} + \\int\\frac12 e^{2x}dx\\\\\n =& \\frac12 x^2e^{2x} - \\frac12 xe^{2x} + \\frac14 e^{2x} + c\n\\end{align*}"
