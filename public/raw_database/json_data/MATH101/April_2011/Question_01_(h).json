        "The alternating series test says that, given a series\n\n\\[\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty (-1)^n a_n\\]\n\nwhere $a_n$ is a positive sequence such that\n$\\lim_{n\\to \\infty} a_n = 0$, then we have that the series converges. In\nour case, so long as $p > 0$, this satisfies the conditions of the\nalternating series test and so it converges. For $p \\leq 0$, the\nsequence $1/n^p$ does not converge to zero, and so the sequence\ndiverges.\n\nThus the series converges for all $p > 0$."
