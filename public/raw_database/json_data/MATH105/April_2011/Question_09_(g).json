No credit will be\ngiven for the answer without the correct accompanying work.}\n\nYou are given a function $f$ satisfying $f(1,0) = 0,$ $f_x(1,0) = 3,$\nand $f_y(1,0) = -1.$ Find $z'(0)$ if\n\n\\[\\displaystyle{ z(t) = f(e^{3t}, \\sin (2t)) }.\\]",

        "The function \\emph{f} depends on the variables \\emph{x} and \\emph{y}\nwhich themselves are functions of the variable \\emph{t}. We have\n\n\\[\\displaystyle\nz(t) = f(x(t),y(t)) \\quad\\text{and}\\quad x(t) = e^{3t} \\quad\\text{and}\\quad y(t) = \\sin(2t)\\]\nNow, using the chain rule for multivariable functions we obtain\n\n\\[\\frac{dz}{dt}(t) = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}(x(t),y(t))\\frac{dx}{dt}(t) + \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}(x(t),y(t))\\frac{dy}{dt}(t)\\]\nwhich using the notation as in the question statement gives\n\n\\[\\displaystyle\nz'(t) = f_X(x(t),y(t))\\,x'(t) + f_Y\\left(x(t),y(t)\\right)\\,y'(t)\\]\n\nNow we just want to know what's going on at \\emph{t} = 0. We have\n\n\\[\\displaystyle\nx(0) = e^0 = 1 \\quad\\text{and}\\quad y(0)=\\sin(0)=0\\] and since\n\n\\[\\displaystyle\nx'(t) = 3e^{3t} \\quad\\text{and}\\quad y'(t)=2\\cos(2t)\\] we have\n\n\\[\\displaystyle\nx'(0) = 3 \\quad\\text{and}\\quad y'(0)=2\\]\n\nSo we can conclude that\n\n\\begin{align*}\nz'(0) &= f_X(1,0) \\cdot 3 + f_Y(1,0) \\cdot 2\\\\\n&= 3 \\cdot 3 + (-1) \\cdot 2\\\\\n& = 7\n\\end{align*}.\n\nNotice that the provided information for $f(1,0)=0$ was unnecessary."
