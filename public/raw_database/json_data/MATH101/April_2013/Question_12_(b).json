        "If $\\displaystyle f(x) = \\frac{x+\\sin x}{1+x^2}$, then its clear it is\npositive, tends to 0, and agrees with the summands on the natural\nnumbers. So we should prove it is never eventually decreasing. Taking\nthe derivative,\n\n\\[\\displaystyle \nf'(x) = \\frac{(1+\\cos x)(1+x^2)-2x(x+\\sin x)}{(1+x^2)^2}\\]\n\nWe want to show that \\emph{$f$} is never eventually decreasing. For this,\nit suffices to find a sequence \\emph{x\\textsubscript{n}} of values that\ngrow with no limit, and for which \\emph{$f$'(x\\textsubscript{n})} is\npositive. How would be go about finding such a sequence? Let us look at\nthe enumerator more carefully. Our best bet to make\n\\emph{$f$'(x\\textsubscript{n})} positive is to choose\n\\emph{x\\textsubscript{n}} such that the positive term is maximal. This\nis achieved when \\emph{cos(x\\textsubscript{n}) = 1}. In this case,\n\\emph{sin(x\\textsubscript{n}) = 0} and we find that the enumerator\nbecomes\n\\emph{2(1+x\\textsubscript{n}\\textsuperscript{2})-2x\\textsubscript{n}\\textsuperscript{2}\n= 2 \\textgreater{} 0}. Hence, we choose $\\displaystyle x_n = 2n\\pi$ for\nany integer \\emph{n}, and double check that indeed the numerator\nbecomes:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n& (1+\\cos(2n\\pi))(1+(2n\\pi)^2)-2(2n\\pi)((2n\\pi)+\\sin (2n\\pi)) \\\\\n= \\ & 2(1+4n^2\\pi^2)-8n^2\\pi^2 \\\\\n= \\ & 2 > 0\n\\end{align*}\n\nThe denominator is always positive, so $\\displaystyle f'(x_n) > 0$ for\nthese values of $\\displaystyle x_n$, so that $\\displaystyle f(x_n)$ is\nincreasing at these values of $\\displaystyle x_n$. Since\n$\\displaystyle 2n\\pi$ grows with no limit, $\\displaystyle f(x)$ is never\neventually decreasing, and hence the integral test fails."
