        "We will prove this by induction.\n\nThe first case, $n=1$ is easy to go through, indeed\n\n\\[\\displaystyle\n2^1-1 = 2-1 = 1 = a_1\\] so the first term of the sequence matches the\ngeneral formula. You can do as many initial cases as you want, but\nremember, you have to at least one to get your argument started.\n\nThen comes the general case. We say: assume that the statement is true\nfor all values of $n$ up to $m$. We will show that the statement is also\ntrue for $n=m+1$.\n\nBy definition of the sequence ${a_n}$, we know that\n\n\\[\\displaystyle\na_{m+1} = 2a_m+1\\]\n\nAnd we also assume that the statement is true up to $n=m$ hence\n\n\\[\\displaystyle\na_m=2^m-1\\]\n\nCombining these two facts together, we obtain that\n\n\\begin{align*}\na_{m+1} &= 2a_m+1\\\\\n&= 2(2^m-1)+1\\\\\n&=2^{m+1}-2+1\\\\\n&=2^{m+1}-1\n\\end{align*} which is the claimed statement to be proved and so\nconcludes our proof."
