        "Let's say we order \\emph{a} amount of type \\emph{A}, similarly \\emph{b}\nof type \\emph{B} and \\emph{c} of type \\emph{C}. Thus, the total cost can\nbe read as\n\n\\[\\displaystyle 300a + 200b + 400c\\]\n\nwhich is the objective function we must \\emph{minimize}.\n\nThe variables $a, b, c$ are not arbitrary, but must be chosen so that we\nget 70oz of gold and 500oz of silver. A choice of \\emph{a,b,c} leads to\ntwo equations relating to the amount of ore purchased:\n\n\\textbf{Amount of gold:} $\\displaystyle a + b + 2c = 70 \\text{oz}$\n\n\\textbf{Amount of silver:}\n$\\displaystyle 20a + 10b + 10c = 500 \\text{oz}$\n\nPut this into an extended matrix we get:\n\n$\\left[ \\begin{array}{ccc|c}\n1 & 1 & 2 & 70 \\\\ \n20 & 10 & 10 & 500\n\\end{array} \\right]$\n\nWhich we can simplify to the matrix:\n\n$\\left[ \\begin{array}{ccc|c}\n1 & 0 & -1 & -20 \\\\ \n0 & 1 & 3 & 90\n\\end{array} \\right].$\n\nThus, we can consider \\emph{c} to be a free variable. Solving this\nsystem we get\n\n\\begin{align*}\na&=-20+c\\\\\nb&=90-3c\\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\nHaving written each quantity with respect to \\emph{c} we can put it in\nthe cost equation\n\n\\begin{align*}\nC=300a + 200b + 400c &= 300(-20 +c) + 200(90 - 3c) + 400c \\\\\n&= -6000 + 300c + 18000 -600c + 400c \\\\\n&= 12000 + 100c\n\\end{align*}\n\nwhich we now have to minimize. \\emph{C} is an increasing function (it is\nlinear with positive slope) and so choosing the smallest value of\n\\emph{c} possible will yield the minimum. It looks like this value may\nbe \\emph{c=0} however looking at the other formulas tells us that if\n\\emph{c} were zero then \\emph{a} would be -20 and \\emph{b} would be 90.\nWe can't order negative quantities of anything so we actually have\nhidden constraints, namely that\n\n\\[a\\geq0,\\qquad{}b\\geq0,\\qquad{}c\\geq0.\\]\n\nUsing our relations for \\emph{a} and \\emph{b}, this tells us that\n\n\\begin{align*}\nc&\\geq20\\\\\nc&\\leq30\n\\end{align*}\n\nSince we know the cost \\emph{C} is an increasing function, we want to\ntake the smallest \\emph{c} allowable which is \\textbf{\\emph{c = 20}}.\nUsing the equations above we find that this yields \\textbf{\\emph{a = 0}}\nand \\textbf{\\emph{b = 30}}."
