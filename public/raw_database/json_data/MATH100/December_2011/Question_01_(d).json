        "Our goal is to find \\emph{f(3)}. Since \\emph{f(x)} is continuous we know\nthat $f(3) = \\lim_{x \\to 3} f(x)$ and thus finding \\emph{f(3)} amounts\nto finding the limit.\n\nUsing the limit laws we have\n\n\\[1 = \\lim_{x \\to 3} (xf(x) + g(x)) = \\lim_{x \\to 3} x \\lim_{x \\to 3} f(x) + \\lim_{x \\to 3} g(x).\\]\nUsing that both functions \\emph{x} and \\emph{g(x)} are continuous, we\nhave that\n\n\\[\\lim_{x \\to 3} x = 3\\] and\n\n\\[\\lim_{x \\to 3} g(x) = g(3) = 2.\\] Plugin this into the above equality,\nwe find\n\n\\[1 = 3 \\lim_{x \\to 3} f(x) + 2\\] and hence\n\n\\[\\lim_{x \\to 3} f(x) = - \\frac{1}{3} .\\]\n\nBy the first remark above we have\n\n\\[\\displaystyle f(3) =  - \\frac{1}{3}.\\]"
