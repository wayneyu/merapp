        "Integral (2) is written in cylindrical coordinates, where the limit of\nthe variables of integration is $\\displaystyle \\theta\\in[0,2\\pi]$ for\nthe horizontal angle, $\\displaystyle r\\in[0,\\sqrt{3}]$ for the radius\n$\\displaystyle r=\\sqrt{x^2+y^2}$ and\n$\\displaystyle z\\in\\left[\\sqrt{3}r, 4-\\frac{r}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right]$ for the\nvertical $\\displaystyle z$ axis.\n\n Finding the equation of the enclosing cone from below\n\nThe variables $\\displaystyle r, \\ \\theta$ are in dependent and the angle\ncovers the whole horizontal circle. The variable $\\displaystyle z$ is\ndepending or $\\displaystyle r$. Hence, the region of integration is\nbounded from below by the equation\n\n\\begin{align*}\n z &= \\sqrt{3}r = \\sqrt{3}\\sqrt{x^2+y^2}\\\\\nz^2 &= 3x^2+3y^2\n\\end{align*}\n\nwhich is a cone-equation.\n\n Finding the equation of the enclosing cone from above\n\nFurther, the region of integration is bounded from above by the equation\n\n\\begin{align*}\n  z &= 4-\\frac{r}{\\sqrt{3}} =4-\\frac{\\sqrt{x^2+y^2}}{\\sqrt{3}}\\\\\n 3(z-4)^2 &= x^2+y^2\n\\end{align*}\n\nwhich is also a cone-equation.\n\n Region of integration is part of body of head?\n\nThe lower cone $\\displaystyle z^2 = 3x^2+3y^2$ contains the point\n$\\displaystyle (0,0,0)$ which is the center of the sphere\n$\\displaystyle x^2+y^2+z^2=12$, the body of the snowman. Hence, a\nregion above this cone is part of the body of the snowman.\n\nThe upper cone $\\displaystyle 3(z-4)^2 = x^2+y^2$ contains the point\n$\\displaystyle (0,0,4)$ which is the center of the sphere\n$\\displaystyle x^2+y^2+(z-4)^2 = 4$, the head of the snowman. Hence, a\nregion below this cone is part of the head of the snowman.\n\nSo, the region of integration contains part of the head and the body of\nthe snowman."
