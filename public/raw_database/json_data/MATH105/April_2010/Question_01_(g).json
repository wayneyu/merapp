    "statement": "Let \\emph{m} be a positive number. If the volume of the solid of\nrevolution generated by revolving about the \\emph{x}-axis the region\nunder the graph of\n\n\\[y = \\sqrt{x}\\]\n\nfrom \\emph{x = 0} to \\emph{x = m} is $2\\pi$, find the positive number\n\\emph{m}.",

        "Using the disc method of integration, we know that the volume of the\nsolid can be expressed as follows:\n\n\\[V = \\int_{0}^{m}\\pi (\\sqrt{x})^{2}\\,dx = \\int_{0}^{m}\\pi x\\,dx = \\pi \\frac{m^{2}}{2}.\\]\n\nWe want the value of $m$ such that the volume is equal to $2\\pi$, so we\nsolve the equation:\n\n\\[\\pi\\frac{m^{2}}{2} = 2\\pi \\quad \\rightarrow \\quad m = \\pm 2.\\]\n\nTaking the positive solution gives us our answer\\[m = 2.\\]"
