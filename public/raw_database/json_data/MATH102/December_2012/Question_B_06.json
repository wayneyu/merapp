    "statement": "There are six neurons connected to a muscle. If four or more of the\nneurons fire at the same time, the muscle contracts. In any millisecond,\neach neuron has a 0.3 probability of firing. What is the probability\nthat the muscle contracts in any particular millisecond? You don't have\nto simplify your answer.",

        "(In what follows, the notation \\emph{P(outcome)} should be read as ``the\nprobability that 'outcome' occurs.'')\n\nIn order to solve this problem, we need to break it down into pieces. We\nare asked to find:\n\n\\begin{description}\n\\itemsep1pt\\parskip0pt\\parsep0pt\n\\item[]\n\\emph{P(muscle contracts)}\n\\end{description}\n\nA muscle contracts if 4 or more neurons fire. Since there are 6 neurons\ntotal we can rewrite this probability as:\n\n\\begin{description}\n\\itemsep1pt\\parskip0pt\\parsep0pt\n\\item[]\n\\emph{P(muscle contracts) = P(4, 5, or 6 neurons fire)}\n\\end{description}\n\nWhen you have different outcomes joined by an ``or'', you can separate\nthe outcomes into individual probabilities and add them together. So\n\n\\begin{description}\n\\itemsep1pt\\parskip0pt\\parsep0pt\n\\item[]\n\\emph{P(4, 5, or 6 neurons fire) = P(4 neurons fire) + P(5 neurons fire)\n+ P(6 neurons fire)}\n\\end{description}\n\nHopefully the problem is more manageable now - we're just computing\nthree individual probabilities and then add them up. Let's start with\nthe last one, because it's the easiest. (For ease, we will be calling\nthe six neurons \\textbf{a, b, c, d, e} and \\textbf{f}.)\n\n\\begin{description}\n\\itemsep1pt\\parskip0pt\\parsep0pt\n\\item[]\n\\emph{P(6 neurons fire) = P(\\textbf{a} and \\textbf{b} and \\textbf{c} and\n\\textbf{d} and \\textbf{e} and \\textbf{f} fire)}\n\\end{description}\n\nRecall that when probabilities are joined by an ``and'', you multiply\nthem. Since the probability of each neuron firing is \\emph{.3}, this\nmeans that\n\n\\begin{description}\n\\itemsep1pt\\parskip0pt\\parsep0pt\n\\item[]\n\\emph{P(6 neurons fire) = (.3)\\textsuperscript{6}}\n\\end{description}\n\nNow onto the next probability, \\emph{P(5 neurons fire)}. Suppose I had a\nlist of 5 specific neurons I wanted to fire, say \\textbf{a} and\n\\textbf{b} and \\textbf{c} and \\textbf{d} and \\textbf{e}. Since only 5\nare firing, this also means the sixth neuron \\textbf{f} does not fire,\nwhich has a probability of \\emph{.7}. The probability of this specific\ncombination occurring involves multiplying the probability for each\nneuron firing/not firing, which gives\n\\emph{(.3)\\textsuperscript{5}(.7)}. However, this is not the only\ncombination of 5 neurons that can fire - we need to include all possible\ncombinations of 5 neurons. This can be done using the binomial\n$\\binom{6}{5}$. Since the same \\emph{(.3)\\textsuperscript{5}(.7)}\nprobability will occur for each list of 5 neurons, our overall\nprobability is\n\n\\begin{description}\n\\itemsep1pt\\parskip0pt\\parsep0pt\n\\item[]\n\\emph{P(5 neurons fire) = $\\binom{6}{5}$(.3)\\textsuperscript{5}(.7)}\n\\end{description}\n\nFinally, computing \\emph{P(4 neurons fire)}, we use the same method as\nthe previous probability. The probability that a specific group of 4\nneurons will fire is \\emph{(.3)\\textsuperscript{4}}, the probability\nthat the other two neurons do not fire is\n\\emph{(.7)\\textsuperscript{2}}, and the number of groups of 4 neurons is\nfound by the binomial $\\binom{6}{4}$, giving\n\n\\begin{description}\n\\itemsep1pt\\parskip0pt\\parsep0pt\n\\item[]\n\\emph{P(4 neurons fire) =\n$\\binom{6}{4}$(.3)\\textsuperscript{4}(.7)\\textsuperscript{2}}\n\\end{description}\n\nSince we don't need to simplify any further, we can simply add our\nprobabilities together as shown above to get a final answer of:\n\n\\begin{description}\n\\itemsep1pt\\parskip0pt\\parsep0pt\n\\item[]\n\\emph{P(muscle contracts) = (.3)\\textsuperscript{6} +\n$\\binom{6}{5}$(.3)\\textsuperscript{5}(.7)}+\n$\\binom{6}{4}$(.3)\\textsuperscript{4}(.7)\\textsuperscript{2}''\n\\end{description}"
