You do not need to simplify or evaluate this\nintegral.",

        "To evaluate this volume, we would use the method of cylindrical shells.\nWe must determine first where the endpoints for the bounded area are. So\nwe solve the following equation:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n4 - x^{2} &= 2 - x\\\\\n0 &= x^{2} - x - 2\\\\\n0 &= (x + 1)(x - 2) \\quad \\rightarrow \\quad x = -1,2.\n\\end{align*}\n\nFor the method of cylindrical shells, we are basically summing up terms\nof the form $2\\pi r h \\Delta r$ where $r$ is the distance of each shell\nto the axis of rotation and $h$ is the height of the shell at radius\n$r$. The distance from the point $x$ to the axis of rotation is\n$r = |x - 2| = 2 - x$ (since we are integrating over $[-1,2]$), and the\nheight $h$ is just the difference of the functions that define the\nboundaries. Thus, the volume of the described object can be evaluating\nby the following integral:\n\n\\[V = \\int_{-1}^{2} 2\\pi (2 - x) (4 - x^{2} - (2 - x))\\,dx\\]\n\n(Note: Evaluating the volume gives $V = 27\\pi / 2$.)"
