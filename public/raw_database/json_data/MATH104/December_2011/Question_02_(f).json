        "\\textbf{Vertical Asymptotes}\n\nWe know that vertical asymptotes occur when the denominator is zero.\nHere our denominator is\n\n\\[\\displaystyle{}x^2-3\\]\n\nwhich is zero if $\\scriptstyle x=\\pm\\sqrt{3}$. Therefore we have\nvertical asymptotes at $\\scriptstyle x=-\\sqrt{3}$ and\n$\\scriptstyle x=\\sqrt{3}$.\n\nTo see how the function looks near the asymptotes we could take some\nlimits. However, from\n\\href{Science:Math_Exam_Resources/Courses/MATH104/December_2011/Question_2_(d)}{part\n(d)} we have that the function is decreasing to the left of\n$\\scriptstyle x=-\\sqrt{3}$ as well as to the right. Therefore we\nconclude that\n\n\\[\\lim_{x\\to-\\sqrt{3}^-}f(x)=-\\infty\\]\n\nwhile\n\n\\[\\lim_{x\\to-\\sqrt{3}^+}f(x)=+\\infty\\]\n\nWe have the exact same conclusion about the other vertical asymptote at\n$\\scriptstyle x=\\sqrt{3}$ since it has the same decreasing properties as\n$\\scriptstyle x=\\sqrt{3}$.\n\n\\textbf{Horizontal or Slant Asymptotes}\n\nWe check for horizontal or slant asymptotes. Since the degree of the\nnumerator is larger than the degree of the denominator then we do not\nhave any horizontal asymptotes. However, the degree of the numerator is\nexactly one larger than the degree of the denominator and so we do\nexpect slant asymptotes. To figure out the slant asymptote we perform\npolynomial long division\n\n\\[\\begin{array}{cccccccccccc}\n&&&&&x&+&1&&&&\\\\\n&&&&&\\_&\\_&\\_&\\_&\\_&\\_&\\_\\\\\nx^2&+&0x&-&3)&x^3&+&x^2&-&2x&-&3\\\\\n&&&&&x^3&+&0x^2&-&3x&&\\\\\n&&&&&\\_&\\_&\\_&\\_&\\_&\\_&\\_\\\\\n&&&&&&&x^2&+&x&-&3\\\\\n&&&&&&&x^2&+&0x&-&3\\\\\n&&&&&\\_&\\_&\\_&\\_&\\_&\\_&\\_\\\\\n&&&&&&&&&x&&\n\\end{array}\\]\n\nTherefore we write $\\displaystyle {}x^3+x^2-2x-3=(x^2-3)(x+1)+x$. So we\nget that\n\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{x^3+x^2-2x-3}{x^2-3} &= \\frac{(x^2-3)(x+1)+x}{x^2-3} \\\\\n&= x+1+\\frac{x}{x^2-3}\n\\end{align*}\n\nNotice that for the last term,\n\n\\[\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}\\frac{x}{x^2-3}=0.\\]\n\nTherefore as \\emph{x} gets big we see that\n\n\\[\\frac{x^3+x^2-2x-3}{x^2-3}\\]\n\nlooks like \\emph{x+1}. If we take \\emph{x} going to\n$\\scriptstyle -\\infty$ we see that the limit of the last term still\nvanishes and it still looks like $x+1$. Therefore, we conclude that\n$x+1$ is a slant asymptote to the function.\n\n\\textbf{Summary}\n\nFinally then we conclude that the equations for the vertical asymptotes\nare\n\n\\begin{align*}\nx&=-\\sqrt{3}\\\\\nx&=\\sqrt{3}\n\\end{align*}\n\nwhile the equation of the slant asymptote is\n\n\\[\\displaystyle{}y=x+1.\\]"
