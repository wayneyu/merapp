        "Following the hint, we first find a suitable value for \\emph{M}. To do\nthis, we need the second derivative. Computing gives\n\n\\begin{align*}\nf(x) &= \\cos(x)\\\\\nf'(x) &= -\\sin(x)\\\\\nf''(x) &= -\\cos(x)\\end{align*}\n\nand thus\n\n\\begin{align*}\n|f''(x)| = |-\\cos(x)| \\leq 1 = M\\end{align*}\n\nwhere the above bound holds for any value of \\emph{x}. Plugging into the\nupper bound on the error in a linear approximation as given by the hint,\nwe have\n\n$|R_{1}(0.25)| \\leq \\frac{M}{2}|0.25-0|^{2} = \\frac{1}{2}|0.25-0|^{2} = \\frac{1}{32}$\n\ncompleting the question."
