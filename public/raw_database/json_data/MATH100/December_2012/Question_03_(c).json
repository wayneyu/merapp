        "By the mean value theorem, we have a constant \\emph{c} between 1 and 4\nsuch that\n\n$\\frac{f(4)-f(1)}{4-1} \\leq f'(c) \\leq -2$\n\nCross multiplying yields\n\n$f(4)-f(1) \\leq -2(4-1) = -6$\n\nSince $f(1) = 3$, isolating for $f(4)$ gives\n\n$f(4) \\leq -6 + f(1) = -6+3 = -3$\n\nThus the largest value $f(4)$ can be is -3."
