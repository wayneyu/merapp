A sample of the radioactive substance Rhodium-101 decayed to 12.5\\%\nof its original amount after 10 years.\n\n(a) What percentage of the original amount is remaining after another 5\nyears?",

        "Proceeding as the hint, let $\\displaystyle y(t) = Ce^{kt}$ be the\npercentage of material remaining after \\emph{t} years.\n\nAt time 0, we have 100\\% left, so we write:\n\n\\begin{align*} 100 &= y(0) \\\\\n &= Ce^{k0} \\\\\n &= C \\end{align*}\n\nNext, we know that after 10 years, there is 12.5\\% left, thus using\n$C = 100$:\n\n\\begin{align*} 12.5 &= y(10) \\\\\n &= 100e^{10k}\\end{align*}\n\nDividing by 100 and taking natural logarithms of both sides will give:\n\n$\\displaystyle \\ln(12.5/100) = \\ln(e^{10k})$\n\nBecause $e^x$ and $\\ln(x)$ are inverses, the right side simplifies to:\n\n$\\displaystyle \\ln(12.5/100) = 10k$\n\nAnd we can solve for \\emph{k}:\n\n$\\displaystyle k = \\ln(12.5/100)/10 = \\ln(1/8)/10$.\n\nNow, we are looking for the percentage remaining after 15 years, or\n$\\displaystyle y(15)$, so plugging in the data gives\n$\\displaystyle y(15) = 100e^{15(\\ln(1/8)/10)} = 100e^{\\ln((1/8)^{15/10})} = 100(1/8)^{3/2}$\n\ncompleting the question."
