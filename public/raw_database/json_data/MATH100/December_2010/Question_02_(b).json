After 30 minutes in a $19^{\\circ}C$ room, its temperature\nis $11^{\\circ}C$.\n\nFind the temperature of the apple 90 minutes after it is taken from the\nrefrigerator, expressed as an integer number of degrees Celsius.",

        "Proceeding as in the hints, let\n\n$\\displaystyle\ny(t) = T(t) - 19$\n\nThen, Newton's law of cooling reads\n\n$\\displaystyle\n\\frac{dy}{dt} = \\frac{dT}{dt} = k(T(t) - 19) = ky(t)$\n\nSolving this differential equation gives\n\n$\\displaystyle\ny(t) = y(0)e^{kt}$\n\nIn terms of \\emph{T} and using the initial condition $T(0) = 3$, we have\n\n$\\displaystyle\nT(t) - 19 = (T(0) - 19)e^{kt} = (3-19)e^{kt} = -16e^{kt}$\n\nAfter 30 minutes, we know $T(30) = 11$ and so\n\n$\\displaystyle\n-16e^{30k} = T(30)-19 = 11-19 = -8$\n\nSolving for \\emph{k} by isolating and taking logarithms gives\n\n$\\displaystyle\nk = \\frac{\\ln(1/2)}{30} = -\\frac{\\ln(2)}{30}$\n\nWe want to find the temperature after 90 minutes and so\n\n\\begin{align*}\nT(90) - 19  &= -16e^{90\\cdot(-\\ln(2))/30} \\\\\n&= -16e^{-3\\ln(2)} \\\\\n&= -16e^{\\ln(2^{-3})} \\\\\n&= -16(1/8) \\\\\n&= -2\n\\end{align*}\n\nand thus $T(90) = 19-2 = 17$ degrees celsius"
