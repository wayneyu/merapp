Take the\nderivative of $f$ with respect to $x$, treating $y$ as a relative\nconstant (use the chain rule):\n\n\\[\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = \\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}((1 - x)y)\\right)e^{(1 - x)y} = -ye^{(1 - x)y}.\\]\nNow we just substitute $(x,y) = (2,1)$:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}(2,1) &= -1e^{(1 - 2)1} \\\\ &= -e^{-1}\n\\end{align*}"
