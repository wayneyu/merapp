Let $S = PQ$\nSince the matrices \\emph{P} and \\emph{Q} are orthogonal, this means that\nthe vectors are real. This means that $P^* = P^T$\n\nThen\n\n\\begin{align*}\nS^TS &= (PQ)^TPQ \\\\\n&= Q^TP^TPQ \\\\\n&= Q^TIQ \\qquad \\text{since P is orthogonal} \\\\\n&= Q^TQ  \\\\\n&=I\n\\end{align*}\n\nSimilarly, $SS^T$ = $PQ(PQ)^T$ = $PQQ^TP^T$ = $PIP^T$ = $PP^T$ = $I$\n\n$\\therefore S^TS = SS^T = I$ and the product of two orthogonal matrices\nis also orthogonal."
