Let \\emph{D} be the incidence\nmatrix (for some choice of labeling and arrows for the remaining edges)\nand let \\emph{L} be the Laplacian.\n\n\\textbf{(e)} It seems reasonable to conjecture that the effective\nresistance between nodes 1 and 6 would remain unchanged if removed the\nresistors between 2 and 3, 3 and 4, 4 and 5, 5 and 2. Explain how you\ncould use MATLAB/Octave to test this conjecture. Assume that \\emph{L}\nhas been defined in MATLAB/Octave.",

        "To find the effective resistance between two nodes, you would have to\nswap the 1st and sixth columns to the 1 and 2 positions inside the\nLaplacian matrix. You would then break up this Laplacian matrix into a\nblock matrix\\[L = \\begin{bmatrix}\nA & B^{T} \\\\\nB & C \n\\end{bmatrix}\\] where $A$ will be a 2x2 matrix.\n\nYou would then find the voltage to current map (A.K.A Schur$^{\\prime}$s\ncomplement), matrix S whose equation is\\[S = A - B^{T} C^{-1} B\\]\n\nThen, after solving for S, the effective resistance would be the\nreciprocal of the 1st entry of matrix S.\n\nMATLAB CODE:\n\n\\texttt{~~~\\%nodes~n~and~m~position}\\\\\\texttt{~~~n~=~1;}\\\\\\texttt{~~~m~=~6;}\\\\\\texttt{~~~}\\\\\\texttt{~~~\\%find~the~size~of~the~matrix~L}\\\\\\texttt{~~~lenL~=~length(L);}\\\\\\texttt{~~~}\\\\\\texttt{~~~\\%swap~nodes~n~and~m~to~the~1st~and~2nd~position~in~the~Laplacian~matrix}\\\\\\texttt{~~~swap~=~{[}n,~m,~1:(n-1),~(n+1):(m-1),~(m+1):lenL{]};}\\\\\\texttt{~~~L~=~L(swap,~swap);}\\\\\\texttt{~~~}\\\\\\texttt{~~~\\%compute~matrix~S~which~is~the~voltage~to~current~map~(Schur's~complement).}\\\\\\texttt{~~~A~=~L((1:2),~(1:2));}\\\\\\texttt{~~~B~=~L((3:lenL),~(1:2));}\\\\\\texttt{~~~C~=~L((3:lenL),~(3:lenL));}\\\\\\texttt{~~~S~=~A~-~(B}$^{\\prime}$\\texttt{~*~C}\\textsuperscript{\\texttt{(}}\\texttt{-1)~*~B);}\\\\\\texttt{~~~}\\\\\\texttt{~~~\\%finds~the~effective~resistance~which~is~the~first~entry~of~S.}\\\\\\texttt{~~~r~=~1/S(1,1);}\n\nYou could run this for the 2 different Laplacian matrices to find the\neffective resistance for each and compare them to confirm the conjecture\nis correct."
