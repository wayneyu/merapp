        "By Fermat's Little Theorem, we have that\n\n$\\displaystyle x^{52578} \\equiv 1 \\mod{52579}$.\n\nThe given problem tells us that\n\n$\\displaystyle x^{5} \\equiv 1 \\mod{52579}$\n\nUsing the Euclidean Algorithm, we can find integers \\emph{a} and\n\\emph{b} such that\n\n$\\displaystyle 5a + 52578b = \\gcd(52578,5) = 1$.\n\nThus we have that\n\n$\\displaystyle x \\equiv x^{5a + 52578b} \\equiv x^{5a}x^{52578b} \\equiv (x^{5})^{a}(x^{52578})^{b} \\equiv 1 \\mod{52579}$\n\nand this completes the proof. The other property that we used about\n52579 is that 52578 and 5 are coprime."
