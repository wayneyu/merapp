        "First, we graph the constant solutions to the differential\nequation\\begin{align*}y=k\\end{align*} and $y= - k.$ These are the solutions we got from part\na. \\includegraphics[width=.5\\textwidth]{Math103April2012Problem4fGraph1.jpg}\n\nThen, we graph the solution from part (c). Since 3k is larger than the\nconstant solution k, it follows that the graph must stay above this line\n(since if y = k at any point $t_0$ , then y must be equal to k for all\n$t > t_0$). Furthermore, if this holds, then y\\^{}2 \\textgreater{}\nk\\^{}2, so from the differential equation given in the problem\nstatement, $\\frac{dy}{dt}$ is negative and therefore the function is\ndecreasing.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htbp]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=.5\\textwidth]{Math103April2012Problem4fGraph2.jpg}\n\\caption{Math103April2012Problem4fGraph2.jpg}\n\\end{figure}\n\nNow, we graph the solutions from part (d) and (e). Since $\\frac{k}{2}$\nand $-\\frac{k}{2}$ are between -k and k, it follows that the graphs for\neach of these solutions must lie between the constant solutions y=-k and\ny=k. The graph from part d has $y(0) = \\frac{k}{2}$. Note that for any\n$0 < y < \\frac{k}{2}$, dy/dt is positive, so the solution to the\ndifferential equation given in (d) should be increasing. We know that\nthe limit of the function as $t \\to \\infty$ is k. Similarly, if we plug\na y-value such that -k \\textless{} y \\textless{} 0 into the differential\nequation, we see that the solution should be decreasing, so the graph of\nthe solution described in part e should decrease to its limit -k.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htbp]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=.5\\textwidth]{Math103April2012Problem4fGraph3.jpg}\n\\caption{Math103April2012Problem4fGraph3.jpg}\n\\end{figure}"

        "We want to graph the solutions to the differential equation with initial\nconditions $y(0) = 3k$, $y(0) = \\frac{k}{2}$, and\n$y(0) = - \\frac{k}{2}$. We know the limiting behavior of each of these\ncases. Use the differential equation to see where each solution is\nincreasing and decreasing, and the fact that the solutions approach the\nconstant solutions calculated in part a, to sketch the graphs."
