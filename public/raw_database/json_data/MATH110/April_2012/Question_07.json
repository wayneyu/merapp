        "The question is asking us to find the ``strongest'' beam, thus we are\noptimizing strength, which is given by the formula $S = kwh^2$. There\nare two variables here: width (w) and height (h). In order to simply the\nformula to one variable, we want to relate \\emph{w} and \\emph{h} using\nanother formula. Looking at the diagram of the log, it would make sense\nto use the Pythagorean theorem, as \\emph{w} and \\emph{h} are the two\nside of a right triangle. Thus we have\n\n\\[w^2 + h^2 = 50^2\\]\n\nNow we can solve this equation for \\emph{w} or \\emph{h} and substitute\nit back into our formula $S = kwh^2$. Which variable should I choose?\nEither one will work, but because I have an $h^2$ in my strength formula\nand an $h^2$ in the Pythagorean theorem, I will solve for $h^2$. Solving\nfor $h^2$ in the Pythagorean theorem gives\n\n\\[h^2 = 50^2 - w^2.\\]\n\nSubstituting this back into my strength formula gives\n\n\\[S = kw (50^2 - w^2)\\]\n\nWhich is now a function in one variable (w) since \\emph{k} is a\nconstant. Note that because the width of the beam is constrained by the\ndiameter of the log, the domain for this function is $[0,50]$.\n\nI know that my function \\emph{S} will be maximized at either the\nendpoints of the domain or at a critical point. The endpoints are\n$w = 0$ and $w = 50$. To find critical points, I first find the\nderivative:\n\n\\[\\displaystyle\nS' = 50^2k - 3kw^2\\]\n\nAnd then set''S''' equal to zero and solve.\n\n\\begin{align*} 0 &= 50^2k - 3kw^2 \\\\ 0 &=k(50^2 - 3w^2) \\\\ 0 &= 50^2 - 3w^2 \\\\ 3w^2 &= 50^2 \\\\ w &= \\pm \\frac{50}{\\sqrt{3}} \\end{align*}\n\nThe negative square root is not in our domain, so we have one critical\npoint, $w = 50/\\sqrt{3}$.\n\nI can check for the maximum in two ways. The first (and more rigorous)\nmethod is to plug the endpoints and critical point back into my function\n$S = kw (50^2 - w^2)$ and compare the values I get.\n\n\\begin{align*}\nw = 0,\\quad &\\quad  S = k(0)(50^2 - 0) = 0 \\\\\nw = \\frac{50}{\\sqrt{3}}, \\quad & \\quad S = k\\frac{50}{\\sqrt{3}}(50^2 - \\frac{50^2}{3}) = \\frac{2\\cdot50^3k}{(3\\sqrt{3})} \\\\\nw = 50, \\quad & \\quad S = k(50)(50^2 - 50^2) = 0\n\\end{align*}\n\nSo $S$ is maximized when $w = 50/\\sqrt{3}$. Recalling that\n$h^2 = 50^2 - w^2$ we can solve for $h = 50\\sqrt{\\frac23}$.\n\nThe second way to check for the maximum to realize that the endpoints\nwill cause $S = kw (50^2 - w^2)$ to be zero (same process as checking\nthe endpoints above), and to perform the first (or second) derivative\ntest to check that $w = 50/\\sqrt{3}$ is a maximum."
