        "We apply the product rule to $f(x)$ to get:\n\n$\\displaystyle f'(x) = g'(x)*x^{1/2} + g(x)*(1/2)(x^{-1/2})$\n\nNow we simply evaluate at \\emph{x = 9}, using the other information\ngiven in the problem to fill in \\emph{g(9)} and \\emph{g'(9)}. Recall\nalso that $x^{1/2} = \\sqrt{x}$.\n\n\\begin{align*}\nf'(9) &= g'(9)*(9)^{1/2} + g(9)*(1/2)(9^{-1/2})\\\\\n&= 4 *3 + 2 *(1/2)(1/3) \\\\\n&= 12 + 1/3\n\\end{align*}\n\nSo the value of $\\displaystyle f'(9)$ is $37/3$."
