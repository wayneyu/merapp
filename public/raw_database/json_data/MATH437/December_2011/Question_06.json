        "Let $\\displaystyle n = 2^{k}m$ with \\emph{k} at least 1. Further, let\n\n\\[\\displaystyle \\sigma(n) = \\sum_{d \\mid n}d\\]\n\nand recall that this function is multiplicative (the sum is over\npositive divisors of \\emph{n}). Since we are given that \\emph{n} is an\neven perfect number, we know that\n\n\\[\\displaystyle 2n = \\sigma(n).\\]\n\nNext, we use the multiplicativity of $\\displaystyle \\sigma$ and see that\n\n\\[\\displaystyle 2^{k+1}m = 2n = \\sigma(n) = \\sigma(2^{k}m) = \\sigma(2^{k})\\sigma(m) = (1 + 2 + 2^{2} + ... + 2^{k})\\sigma(m) = (2^{k+1}-1)\\sigma(m).\\]\n\nSince $\\displaystyle \\gcd(2^{k+1},2^{k+1}-1) = 1$, we see that\n$\\displaystyle (2^{k+1}-1)\\mid m$. Let \\emph{M} be an integer such that\n$\\displaystyle m = (2^{k+1}-1)M$. Substituting this into the above\nyields\n\n$\\displaystyle 2^{k+1}(2^{k+1}-1)M = 2^{k+1}m = (2^{k+1}-1)\\sigma(m)$.\n\nCancelling on both sides yields\n\n$\\displaystyle 2^{k+1}M = \\sigma(m)$.\n\nUsing the fact that both \\emph{m} and \\emph{M} are divisors of \\emph{m}\n(and hence are terms inside the expansion of $\\displaystyle \\sigma(m)$,\nwe have that\n\n$\\displaystyle 2^{k+1}M = \\sigma(m) \\geq m + M = (2^{k+1}-1)M + M = 2^{k+1}M$.\n\nThus, the greater than sign is in fact an equality. This means that\n$\\displaystyle \\sigma(m)$ has only two factors, namely \\emph{m} and\n\\emph{M}. Since $\\displaystyle m > M$, we must have that\n$\\displaystyle M=1$ and so $\\displaystyle m = (2^{k+1}-1)M = 2^{k+1}-1$.\nAs \\emph{m} has only two prime factors, we also know that\n$\\displaystyle m = 2^{k+1}-1$ is prime. This completes the proof."
