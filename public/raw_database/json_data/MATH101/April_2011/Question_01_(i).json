        "We will use the ratio test to prove that this series is absolutely\nconvergent. Each term in the series is\n\n\\begin{align*}a_n = \\frac{(-2011)^n}{n!}\\end{align*}\n\nand so we have that\n\n\\begin{align*}\\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n} = \\frac{\\frac{(-2011)^{n+1}}{(n+1)!}}{ \\frac{(-2011)^n}{n!}} = \\frac{-2011 n!}{(n+1)!} = -\\frac{2011}{n+1}\\end{align*}\n\nWe see then that $\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n} = 0 < 1$, and so\nthe series converges absolutely.", 
        "As per the second hint, we note that the series is given by\n\n\\begin{align*}\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty \\frac{(-2011)^n}{n!} = e^{-2011}\\end{align*}\n\nSince the function $e^x$ converges absolutely over the whole real line,\nit follows that this series does as well."
