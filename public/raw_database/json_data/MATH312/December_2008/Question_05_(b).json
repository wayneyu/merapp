    "statement": "Alice wants Bob to send her a secret integer \\emph{P} between 0 and 1250\nusing RSA encryption with key $\\displaystyle (e, n) = (1189, 1271)$ (so\nthe exponent is 1189 and the modulus is 1271, it is way too small to be\nreally secure, but basic RSA encryption and decryption methods still\nwork of course).\n\n\\textbf{(b)} To obtain \\emph{P} from \\emph{C}, Alice first computes an\ninverse $\\displaystyle d \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ of \\emph{e} modulo\n$\\displaystyle \\phi(n)$, since she created the key, she knows that\n$\\displaystyle 1271 = 31 \\cdot 41$ (in fact, the prime factorization of\nn can easily be found since it is so small). Compute such a \\emph{d}.",
