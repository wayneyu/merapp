        "From\n\\href{Science:Math Exam Resources/Courses/MATH100/December 2011/Question 5 (c)}{part\n(c)}, we know that\n\n\\begin{align*}\nf''(x) &= \\frac{6(x-4)}{25x^{9/5}}\n\\end{align*}\n\nNotice that the potential inflection points are at \\emph{x}=0,4, where\n\\emph{f$^{\\prime\\prime}$(x)} is either zero or undefined. Doing a sign\nchart for this function yields the following. When \\emph{x \\textless{}\n0} we have that \\emph{f$^{\\prime\\prime}$(x) \\textgreater{} 0}. When\n$0 < x < 4$ we have that \\emph{f$^{\\prime\\prime}$(x) \\textless{} 0}.\nWhen $x > 4$ we have that \\emph{f$^{\\prime\\prime}$(x) \\textgreater{} 0}.\nHence, the function is concave up on $(-\\infty, 0) \\cup (4,\\infty)$.\n\n''Note: Since the sign of \\emph{f$^{\\prime\\prime}$(x)} changes at both\npoints, both \\emph{x=0} and \\emph{x=4} are inflection points. Even\nthough \\emph{f$^{\\prime\\prime}$(x)} is not defined at \\emph{x = 0}.''"
