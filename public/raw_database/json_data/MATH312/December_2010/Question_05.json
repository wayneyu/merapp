        "We begin by noting that\n\n$\\displaystyle 2\\cdot 11 = 22 = \\phi(n) = n\\prod_{p \\mid n}\\left(1 - \\frac{1}{p}\\right) = n\\prod_{p \\mid n}\\frac{p-1}{p} = \\prod_{p_{i}^{\\alpha_{i}}\\parallel n}p_{i}^{\\alpha_{i}-1}(p-1)$\n\nwhere above we used the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic to write\n(recall that $\\displaystyle \\parallel$ means \\emph{fully divides})\n\n$\\displaystyle n = \\prod_{p_{i}^{\\alpha_{i}}\\parallel n} p_{i}^{\\alpha_{i}}.$\n\nOur \\emph{main equation} of discussion will be\n\n$\\displaystyle 2\\cdot 11 = \\prod_{p_{i}^{\\alpha_{i}}\\parallel n}p_{i}^{\\alpha_{i}-1}(p_{i}-1)$.\n\nWe proceed in cases. First we discuss the powers of 2 in \\emph{n}.\n\n\\textbf{Case 1\\begin{align*}\\displaystyle 8 \\mid n\\end{align*}}. In this case, notice that 4\ndivides the right hand side of the main equation but only 2 divides the\nleft hand side. This is a contradiction.\n\n\\textbf{Case 2\\begin{align*}\\displaystyle 4 \\parallel n\\end{align*}}. In this case, notice\nthat 2 divides the right hand side of the main equation and 2 divides\nthe left hand side. However, if another odd prime divides \\emph{n}, then\nthe right hand side is divisible by an extra power of 2 which is a\ncontradiction. The remaining subcase in this case is if no odd primes\ndivde \\emph{n}, that is, $\\displaystyle n = 4$. But since also\n$\\displaystyle \\phi(4) = 2 \\neq 22$ this case cannot occur.\n\n'''Case 3\\begin{align*}\\displaystyle 2 \\parallel n\\end{align*} or \\emph{n} is odd'''. In\neither of these cases, since $\\displaystyle \\phi$ is multiplicative and\nas $\\displaystyle \\phi(2) = 1$, we have that either of these cases can\noccur, that is, if $\\displaystyle \\phi(n) = 22$, then\n$\\displaystyle \\phi(2n) = 22.$ Therefore, without loss of generality, we\nsuppose 2 does not divide $\\displaystyle n$.\n\nNow we deal with the odd primes. Notice that for each odd prime, we get\na factor of 2 on the right hand side of the main equation. Thus only\nexactly one odd prime can occur. Thus $\\displaystyle n = p^{\\alpha}$.\nSince only 2 and 11 occur as prime factors on the left hand side of the\nequation, we know that we must have that $\\displaystyle \\alpha \\leq 2$\n(the right hand side of the main equation has an\n$\\displaystyle p^{\\alpha-1}$ term so the factor could be 2). If\n$\\displaystyle \\alpha =2$, then the prime \\emph{p} in question must be\n11 since \\emph{p} divides the right hand side. So\n$\\displaystyle n = 11^{2}$ but this is inadmissable since\n$\\displaystyle \\phi(11^{2}) \\neq 22$. Thus \\emph{n} is a prime. For\nprimes, we have that $\\displaystyle \\phi(p) = p-1$. This value we know\nis 22 and so $\\displaystyle n = 23$.\n\nThus combining the two discussions shows us that either\n$\\displaystyle n = 23$ or $\\displaystyle n = 46$ completing the\nquestion."
