The distance the height\ntravels aroudn the \\emph{y}-axis is $2\\pi r$ and hence, we have\n\n\\begin{align*}\nV &= \\int_{\\pi/2}^{\\pi}2\\pi(x)(\\sin(x)/x)\\,dx\\\\\n&= \\int_{\\pi/2}^{\\pi}2\\pi\\sin(x)\\,dx\\\\\n&= 2\\pi(-\\cos(x))\\bigg|_{\\pi/2}^{\\pi} \\\\\n&= 2\\pi(-\\cos(\\pi) + \\cos(\\pi/2))\\\\\n&= 2\\pi(-(-1) + 0)\\\\\n&= 2\\pi\n\\end{align*}"
