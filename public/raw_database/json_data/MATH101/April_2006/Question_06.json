        "\\emph{Probability was not covered this year, hence this is not material\nfor the April 2012 exam.}\n\nSince \\emph{f}(\\emph{x}) = 0 for \\emph{x}\u2264 0 it follows that \\emph{m}\n\\textgreater{} 0. Now we can directly compute \\emph{m}:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac12 &= \\int_{-\\infty}^m f(x)\\,dx \\\\\n&= \\int_{-\\infty}^0 0\\,dx + \\int_0^m 2xe^{-x^2}\\,dx\n\\end{align*}\n\nWe use the substitution \\emph{u} = \\emph{x}\\textsuperscript{2},\n\\emph{du} = 2\\emph{x} \\emph{dx}. Then \\emph{u}(0) = 0 and\n\\emph{u}(\\emph{m}) = \\emph{m}\\textsuperscript{2}. Hence\n\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac12 &= \\int_{-\\infty}^m f(x)\\,dx \\\\\n&= \\int_{-\\infty}^0 0\\,dx + \\int_0^m 2xe^{-x^2}\\,dx \\\\\n&= \\int_0^{m^2} e^{-u}\\,du \\\\\n&= \\left.-e^{-u}\\right|_0^{m^2} \\\\\n&= -e^{-m^2}+e^0 \\\\\n&= 1-e^{-m^2}.\n\\end{align*}\n\nIn other words, \\emph{m} satisfies\n\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac12 &= 1-e^{-m^2} \\\\\ne^{-m^2} &= \\frac12 \\\\\n-m^2 &= \\ln(2^{-1}) \\\\\nm^2 &= \\ln 2 \\\\\nm &= \\pm\\sqrt{\\ln 2}\n\\end{align*}\n\nNote that we can rule out the solution $m = -\\sqrt{\\ln 2}$ since we\nalready noted that \\emph{m} is positive.\n\nHence, the solution is $m=\\sqrt{\\ln 2}$."
