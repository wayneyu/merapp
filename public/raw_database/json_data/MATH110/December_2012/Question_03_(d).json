        "First we need to find a formula for $f(\\theta)$, the area of the\ntriangle. The area of a triangle is $(b)(h)/2$. See the labeled picture\nbelow:\n\n\\begin{figure}[htbp]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=.5\\textwidth]{MER_MATH110_December_2012_Question_3d_labeled_diagram.jpg}\n\\caption{MER MATH110 December 2012 Question 3d labeled diagram.jpg}\n\\end{figure}\n\nThe base of the triangle is a radius of the circle, which is equal to 1.\nWe can find the height by a trig ratio. Using the blue right triangle,\nwe can see that $\\sin\\theta = h/1$. So $h = \\sin\\theta$. Plugging these\ninto our area formula, we get:\n\n$\\displaystyle f(\\theta) = (1)(\\sin\\theta)/2 = (\\sin \\theta)/2$\n\nIt is now easy to find the derivative,\n\n$\\displaystyle f'(\\theta) = (\\cos \\theta)/2$\n\ncompleting the question."
