        "The stationary distribution is the eigenvector corresponding to\neigenvalue 1. The other two eigenvectors correspond to eigenvalues with\nabsolute value strictly less than 1. This means that only the component\nof the initial distribution that is parallel to the stationary\ndistribution will maintain its length over repeated applications of P.\nSince the 3x3 matrix \\emph{P} has three distinct eigenvalues, every\nvector of initial conditions can be composed to a sum of eigenvectors.\nHence, all components of the initial distribution that are not parallel\nto the stationary distribution will decay with repeated applications of\nP.\n\nHence, all initial distributions eventually converge to the stationary\ndistribution computed in part\n\\href{Science:Math_Exam_Resources/Courses/MATH152/April_2012/Question_07_(c)}{(c)}."
