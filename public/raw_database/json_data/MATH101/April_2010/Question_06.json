        "\\emph{There is a certain ambiguity to how the diagram presents this\nproblem. While it talks of a standard swimming pool with an inclined\nplane along the bottom, the diagram looks as if the top-side is\ninclined. Therefore we will present a solution where the bottom is flat\nand the top side is inclined and another solution where the top is flat\nand the bottom side is inclined. The approach to both problems is the\nsame but the numerical results will differ.}\n\n\\textbf{Top Inclined, Bottom Flat:}\n\nCreate a diagram (like that to the right) that just illustrates the side\nof pool we are interested in\n\\href{file:Math101Apr20106.png}{right\\textbar{}500px\\textbar{}thumbnail}.\nWe will use the standard coordinate system of $x$ representing the\nhorizontal direction and $y$ representing the vertical direction.\n\nNotice we can divide the figure into a rectangular portion and a\ntriangular portion which in the diagram is separated by a dashed line.\nSince this triangular portion is actually a right triangle we can\ndetermine the missing size $z$ to be\n\n\\begin{align*}z=\\sqrt{20^2-1^2}=\\sqrt{399}.\\end{align*}\n\nNow we are interested in determining the hydrostatic force that is\nexerted on this pool wall. From the hint we know this depends on the\npressure which we can write as,\n\n\\begin{align*}\\displaystyle{}P=\\rho{}g(2-y)\\end{align*}\n\nwhere we take $y=0$ to be the bottom of the diagram. Notice that because\nof this definition of y, the depth, h, as defined in the hint is then\nactually h=2-y since the top of the surface is at y=2. We see that\ndepending where we are along the pool side, we will exert a different\npressure and therefore a different force. Since the pressure depends on\n$y$, let's consider a very small rectangle of height $\\textrm{d}y$ and\nlength, $L$. The small amount of force exerted on this rectangle of area\n$\\textrm{d}A$ is,\n\n\\begin{align*}\\displaystyle{}\\textrm{d}F=P\\textrm{d}A=\\rho{}g(2-y)Ldy.\\end{align*}\n\nTherefore the total amount of force exerted will be the sum of the\nlittle amounts of force on each rectangle as we go from height $y=0$ to\nheight $y=2$. However, we have to be careful, because as we climb up the\nheight of the pool side, the length of the small rectangles depend on\nour height $y$ due to the pool getting narrower in the triangular\nregion. We will then break up the problem into computing the total force\non the rectangular portion, $F_1$ and the total force on the triangular\nportion, $F_2$. In the end the total force will be, $F=F_1+F_2$.\n\n\\textbf{Rectangular Portion}:\n\nIn this region, for any given height, $y$, the length is a constant and\nin fact we already computed it,\n\n\\begin{align*}L=\\sqrt{399}.\\end{align*}\n\nTherefore, for this region we have that for every little rectangle,\n\n\\begin{align*}\\displaystyle\\textrm{d}F_1=\\rho{g}\\sqrt{399}(2-y)\\textrm{d}y.\\end{align*}\n\nIn order to add up the contributions from all the small rectangles we\nturn to integration,\n\n\\begin{align*}\nF_1=\\int\\textrm{d}F_1&=\\int_0^1\\rho{g}\\sqrt{399}(2-y)\\textrm{d}y\\\\\n&=\\rho{g}\\sqrt{399}\\left.\\left(2y-\\frac{y^2}{2}\\right)\\right|_{0}^1\\\\\n&=\\frac{3\\rho{g}\\sqrt{399}}{2}.\\end{align*}\n\nThe limits of integration can be seen from the diagram since the\nrectangular region starts at the bottom and goes up 1m.\n\n\\textbf{Triangular Portion}:\n\nThis region is slightly more tricky to compute because the length\nchanges with the height. The first thing we need to do is figure out a\nfunction for the slanted side of the triangle in terms of $x$ and $y$.\nWe see that it is a line so it will be of the form $y=mx+b$ with $m$ the\nslope and $b$ the y-intercept. We know that when the height is 1, we are\nat the left edge of the diagram which we will denote $x=0$. When the\nheight is 2, we are at the right edge of the diagram which we know is\n\n\\begin{align*}x=\\sqrt{399}.\\end{align*}\n\nTherefore we get that the slope is\n\n\\begin{align*}m=\\frac{2-1}{\\sqrt{399}-0}=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{399}}\\end{align*}\n\nand the y-intercept occurs when $x=0$ so $b=1$. Therefore, the slanted\nedge of the triangle is given by,\n\n\\begin{align*}y=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{399}}x+1.\\end{align*}\n\nNow at any height, the length of our small rectangle will start at the\nslant edge,\n\n\\begin{align*}x=\\sqrt{399}(y-1)\\end{align*}\n\nand extend to the right edge of the diagram at $x=\\sqrt{399}$. Therefore\nwe have that the length at any given height $y$, is\n\n\\begin{align*}L(y)=\\sqrt{399}-\\sqrt{399}(y-1)=\\sqrt{399}(2-y).\\end{align*}\n\nThe small amount of force on any rectangle in this region is,\n\n\\begin{align*}\\textrm{d}F_2=P\\textrm{d}A=\\rho{g}yL\\textrm{d}y=\\rho{g}\\sqrt{399}(2-y)(2-y)\\textrm{d}y.\\end{align*}\n\nIn order to get the total force on the triangular region we integrate\nall these little $\\textrm{d}F_2$ over every height in the triangular\nregion. This region starts at $y=1$ and ends at $y=2$. Therefore these\nare our lower and upper limits of integration respectively. We get for\nour total force in this region,\n\n\\begin{align*}\nF_2=\\int\\textrm{d}F_2&=\\int_1^2\\rho{g}\\sqrt{399}(2-y)^2\\textrm{d}y\\\\\n&=\\rho{g}\\sqrt{399}\\int_1^2(y^2-4y+4)\\textrm{d}y\\\\\n&=\\rho{g}\\sqrt{399}\\left(\\frac{y^3}{3}-2y^2+4y\\right)_{1}^2\\\\\n&=\\frac{1}{3}\\rho{g}\\sqrt{399}.\\end{align*}\n\nWe can now compute the total force as,\n\n\\begin{align*}F=F_1+F_2=\\rho{g}\\sqrt{399}\\left(\\frac{3}{2}+\\frac{1}{3}\\right)=\\frac{11}{6}\\rho{g}\\sqrt{399}\\end{align*}\n\nwhich using the numbers provided in the question, $\\rho=1000$ and\n$g=9.8$, we get,\n\n\\begin{align*}F\\approx{}358883.9N\\end{align*}\n\nwhich is a very large force but not unsurprising considering the power\nthat water has.\n\n\\textbf{Caution!!}\n\nYou may be tempted to want to set up an integral with $x$ instead of\n$y$, i.e. a diagram that looks like that to the right\n\\href{file:Math101Apr20106false.png}{right\\textbar{}500px\\textbar{}thumbnail}.\n\nThe problem is that, as we mentioned above, the pressure is a function\nof height. Based on this formulation and this diagram, the small\nrectangles take every height value from the base of the rectangle to the\nslanted edge and so the pressure varies along the whole length of the\nrectangle. You may think that a solution to this problem is to take your\nrectangle of height, $L$ and width $\\textrm{d}x$ and splice it up into\neven \\textbf{smaller} rectangles of say height $\\textrm{d}y$ and width\n$\\textrm{d}x$. You then would have an integration problem on your small\nrectangle from the diagram and then another integration problem as you\nvary $x$ and look at other small rectangles.
