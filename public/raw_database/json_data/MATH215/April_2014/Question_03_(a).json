    "statement": "A small mass can move along the x-axis between two large masses located\nat $x = -1$ and $x = 2$. When subjected to a linear drag its position\n$s(t)$ obeys the differential equation:\n\n$\\displaystyle\ns''(t) = \\frac{-1}{(s + 1)^2} + \\frac{4}{(s - 2)^2} - s'(t), \\quad  -1 < s < 2$\n\n(a) Convert this equation to a first-order nonlinear system valid for\n$1 < s < 2$.",
