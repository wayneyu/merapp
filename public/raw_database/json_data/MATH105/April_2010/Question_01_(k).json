        "The instantaneous rate of change of capital has two components:\n\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\itemsep1pt\\parskip0pt\\parsep0pt\n\\item\n  We continuously add money at a rate of \\$3,000 per year;\n\\item\n  We earn 6\\% interest compounded continuously.\n\\end{itemize}\n\nIf we denote by \\emph{A(t)} the balance of the account at time \\emph{t},\nthen we can write the differential equation\n\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{dA}{dt} &= 3000 + 6%\\,A(t) \\\\\n&= 3000 + 0.06\\,A(t)\\end{align*}\n\nWe solve this equation using separation of variables:\n\n\\begin{align*}\\int \\frac{dA}{3000+0.06A} = \\int\\,dt\\end{align*}\n\nSolving both sides separately yields\n\n\\begin{align*}\\frac1{0.06} \\ln|3000+0.06A| + C_1 = t + C_2\\end{align*}\n\nSince \\emph{A} is positive, as the amount of money in the account, we\ncan drop the absolute value sign. This yields\n\n\\begin{align*}\\displaystyle \\ln(3000+0.06A) = 0.06t + C_3\\end{align*}\n\nor, equivalently\n\n\\begin{align*}3000 + 0.06A = e^{0.06t + C_3} = e^{0.06t}e^{C_3} = C_4 e^{0.06t}.\\end{align*}\n\n\\emph{C\\textsubscript{4}} is another arbitrary, but positive constant.\nHence we obtain for \\emph{A(t)}:\n\n\\begin{align*}A(t) = \\frac1{0.06}\\left(C_4e^{0.06t}-3000\\right).\\end{align*}\n\nNow it's time to think about the initial condition. Since the account\ndoes not start with any balance initially, we know that \\emph{A(0) = 0}.\nThis yields for \\emph{C\\textsubscript{4}} that\n\n\\begin{align*}0 = \\frac1{0.06}\\left(C_4e^{0}-3000\\right), \\quad \\text{which implies} \\quad C_4 = 3000.\\end{align*}\n\nWith this we finally find the expression for the balance in dollars at\n\\emph{t} years:\n\n\\begin{align*}A(t) = \\frac{3000}{0.06}\\left(e^{0.06t}-1\\right).\\end{align*}\n\nThis implies that at \\emph{t = 5} years the balance is\n\n\\begin{align*}A(5) = \\frac{3000}{0.06}\\left(e^{0.06\\cdot 5}-1\\right) = 17 492.94\\end{align*}\n\n\\emph{Reality check:} Without interest we would expect to see \\emph{5 x\n3000 = 15 000} dollars in the account. The amount with interest should\nbe in the same order of magnitude and a little larger."
