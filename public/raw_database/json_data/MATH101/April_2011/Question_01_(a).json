        "We notice that the term $x^2$ is almost the derivative of what is inside\nof the square root (up to a constant term) and so we will use a change\nof variable.\n\nLet $u = x^3+1$. Then we have:\n\n\\begin{align*}\\frac{du}{dx} = 3x^2\\end{align*}\n\nand hence\n\n\\begin{align*}du = 3x^2 \\, dx\\end{align*}\n\nor to match what we have in our integral:\n\n\\begin{align*}\\frac{1}{3} \\, du = x^2 \\, dx\\end{align*}\n\nSince this is a definite integral, we also need to change the bounds of\nintegration. If $x=-1$ then $u=0$ and if $x=0$ then $u=1$. This allows\nus to write:\n\n\\begin{align*}\\int_{-1}^0 x^2 \\sqrt{1+x^3} \\,dx = \\int_0^1 \\frac{1}{3} \\sqrt{u} \\,du\\end{align*}\n\nWhich is an easy integral to compute:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n\\int_0^1 \\frac{1}{3} \\sqrt{u} \\,du \n&= \\frac{1}{3} \\int_0^1 u^{1/2} \\,du \n= \\frac{1}{3} \\left[ \\frac{2}{3} u^{3/2} \\right]_0^1 \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{3} \\left( \\frac{2}{3} \\cdot 1^{3/2} - \\frac{2}{3} \\cdot 0^{3/2} \\right) = \\frac{2}{9}.\\end{align*}", 
        "For such an integral, you do not have to do the change of variable if\nyou can directly figure out the correct antiderivative. Since you have\nthe $x^2$ term outside of the square root, you expect the antiderivative\nto be something like:\n\n\\begin{align*}\\displaystyle (1+x^3)^{3/2}\\end{align*}\n\nTaking the derivative of this, you will see how to modify the constants\nto make it work:\n\n\\begin{align*}\\frac{d}{dx} \\left[ (1+x^3)^{3/2} \\right] = \\frac{3}{2} (1+x^3)^{1/2} \\, 3x^2 = \\frac{9}{2} \\, x^2 \\sqrt{1+x^3}\\end{align*}\n\nAnd so we know that an antiderivative of $x^2 \\sqrt{1+x^3}$ will be\n$\\frac{2}{9} (1+x^3)^{3/2}$. Which allows us to conclude:\n\n\\begin{align*}\\int_{-1}^0 x^2 \\sqrt{1+x^3} dx = \\left[ \\frac{2}{9} (1+x^3)^{3/2} \\right]_{-1}^0 = \\frac{2}{9}\\end{align*}"
