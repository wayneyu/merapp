        "In order to see if $y(x)$ satisfies the differential equation, we need\nto find $y'$, substitute $y$ and $y'$ into the left side of the\ndifferential equation, and see if the resulting expression is equal to\n\\emph{1}.\n\nThus, first, we calculate $y'$.\n\n\\begin{align*}y'(x) = \\frac{x\\left(\\frac1{x}+0\\right)-(\\ln(x)+2)}{x^2} = \\frac{-1-\\ln(x)}{x^2}\\end{align*}\n\nThen we plug $y$ and $y'$ into the left hand side of the differential\nequation.\n\n\\begin{align*}\nx^2y' + xy &= x^2 \\left(\\frac{-1-\\ln(x)}{x^2}\\right) + x\\left(\\frac{\\ln(x)+2}{x}\\right) \\\\\n&= -1-\\ln(x)+\\ln(x)+2 = 1 \\checkmark\\end{align*}\n\nBecause this equals the right hand side of the original differential\nequation, the solution $y(x)$ is correct."
