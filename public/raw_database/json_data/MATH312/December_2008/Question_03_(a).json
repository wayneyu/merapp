        "Proceeding as suggested in the hint, we have\n\n$\\displaystyle 3(7x - 2) \\equiv 0 \\mod{111}$\n\nNow, as $\\displaystyle 111 = 3\\cdot 37$, we see that we must have\n\n$\\displaystyle 7x-2 \\equiv 0 \\mod{37}$\n\nif the above congruence is to hold. Now, isolating gives\n\n$\\displaystyle 7x \\equiv 2 \\mod{37}$\n\nWe can crunch through the Euclidean algorithm to find the inverse of 7\nbut here I will use a clever time saving trick. The right hand side is\nequivalent to\n\n$\\displaystyle 7x \\equiv -35 \\mod{37}$\n\nThus, multiplying by the inverse of 7 on both sides yields\n\n$\\displaystyle x \\equiv -5 \\equiv 32 \\mod{37}$.\n\nThus, modulo 111, the solutions are\n\n$\\displaystyle x \\equiv 32,69,106 \\mod{111}$\n\nseen by adding multiples of 37 to 32."

        "First, isolate for 0, factor then argue that one of the terms has to be\ndivisible by 37. Solve that congruence then lift back to 111."
