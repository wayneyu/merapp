        "This is \\textbf{true}. A is not invertible when det(A) = 0 We know that\nthe characteristic polynomial is p(\u00ce\u00bb) = det(A-\u00ce\u00bbI) If \u00ce\u00bb = 0, then\np(\u00ce\u00bb) = det(A) Therefore, det(A)$\\neq$0 only if p(\u00ce\u00bb)$\\neq$0 However, we\nknow that p(0) = 0 because the eigenvalue, \u00ce\u00bb is the root of the\npolynomial equation. p(\u00ce\u00bb) = (\u00ce\u00bb-\u00ce\u00bb1)(\u00ce\u00bb-\u00ce\u00bb2)...(\u00ce\u00bb-\u00ce\u00bbn) Therefore, if\n\u00ce\u00bb = 0, p(\u00ce\u00bb) = det(A) = 0 and this shows that if \u00ce\u00bb = 0, then A is not\ninvertible"
