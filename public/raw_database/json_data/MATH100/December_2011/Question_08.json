        "We want to use the intermediate value theorem, as suggested by the\nhints. To do this we have to combine the two given functions $f$ and\n\\emph{y} = 2\\emph{x} + 3 to one. So define\n\n\\begin{align*}\\displaystyle h(x) = f(x)-(2x+3)\\end{align*}\n\nfor \\emph{x} in the interval {[}0,1{]}. The function $f$ crosses the line\n\\emph{y} = 2\\emph{x} + 3 when both functions are equal, i.e. at zeros of\nthe function \\emph{h}. Since we are asked to show they cross at least\none, we have to show that the function \\emph{h} has at least one zero.\nIn other words, we need to show that there exists a value \\emph{c} in\n{[}0,1{]} such that \\emph{h}(\\emph{c}) = 0.\n\nTo show this we need to make use of the fact that the range of the\nfunction $f$ is in {[}3,5{]}, i.e.\n\n\\begin{align*}3 \\leq f(x) \\leq 5\\end{align*}\n\nfor any value of \\emph{x} in the domain {[}0,1{]} of the function $f$.\nThis implies that\n\n\\begin{align*}h(0) = f(0) - (2(0)+3) = f(0)-3 \\geq 3-3 = 0.\\end{align*} and\n\n\\begin{align*}h(1) = f(1) - (2(1)+3) = f(1)-5 \\leq 5-5 = 0.\\end{align*}\n\nNow, in the case that either \\emph{h}(0) or \\emph{h}(1) actually takes\nthe value 0, we are done because we have found a zero of \\emph{h}.\n\nIn the case that neither takes the value zero, then we know that\n\n\\begin{align*}\\displaystyle h(1) < 0 < h(0)\\end{align*}\n\nThis is where the Intermediate Value Theorem shines: \\emph{h} is a\ncontinuous function on {[}0,1{]}, hence for any value \\emph{N} between\n\\emph{h}(0) and \\emph{h}(1) there exists a number \\emph{c} =\n\\emph{c}(\\emph{N}) such that\n\n\\begin{align*}\\displaystyle h(c) = N.\\end{align*}\n\nSince we have shown that \\emph{h}(0) is negative and \\emph{h}(1) is\npositive, we can choose that value \\emph{N} to be exactly zero and thus\nthe Intermediate Value Theorem guarantees the existence of a number\n\\emph{c} in the interval {[}0,1{]} such that \\emph{h}(\\emph{c}) = 0.\n\nConclusion: At this value \\emph{c} we have that\n\n\\begin{align*}0 = h(c) = f(c) - (2c+3)\\end{align*} or, in other words, \\emph{f}(\\emph{c}) =\n2\\emph{c}+3, which is what we had to show."
