        "From the hint we see that a linear approximation based on a given point\nis\n\n\\begin{align*}\\displaystyle\ng(x,y) \\approx f(x_0,y_0) + \\left( \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}(x_0,y_0) \\right) \\cdot (x-x_0) + \\left( \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}(x_0,y_0) \\right) \\cdot (y-y_0)\\end{align*}\n\nbut how does this relate to the problem at hand? We want to know how\n\\textbf{small} changes from our current labour/capital setup of (81,16)\nwill affect the overall productivity. If we used our linear\napproximation formula above then if $f(x,y)>f(x_0,y_0)$ then the new\nlabour/capital pairing of (x,y) is better than the old pairing\n$(x_0,y_0)=(81,16)$.\n\nIf we use the first policy and only increase labour by 1 unit\n($x-x_0=1,y-y_0=0$), then since the marginal productivity of labour at\nthe current level ($f_x(81,16)$) is 80, the productivity will be raised\nby approximately 80 dollars since\n\n\\begin{align*}\\displaystyle{}f(x,y)-f(81,16)=f_x(81,16)(1)+f_y(81,16)(0)=80.\\end{align*}\n\nOn the other hand, if we use the second policy, an increase of labour by\n1/2 unit ($x-x_0=1/2$) will increase productivity by\n\n\\begin{align*}\\displaystyle{}f_x(81,16)(x-x_0)=80(1/2)=40\\end{align*}\n\ndollars; and an increase of capital by 1/3 unit ($y-y_0=1/3$) will\nincrease productivity by\n\n\\begin{align*}\\displaystyle{}f_y(81,16)(y-y_0)=135(1/3)= 45\\end{align*}\n\ndollars. The two combined yield an increase of productivity of\napproximately\n\n\\begin{align*}\\displaystyle{}f(x,y)-f(81,16)=f_x(81,16)(1/2)+f_y(81,16)(1/3)=85\\end{align*}\n\ndollars.\n\nSo based on these approximations, the second policy should yield a\nhigher productivity."
