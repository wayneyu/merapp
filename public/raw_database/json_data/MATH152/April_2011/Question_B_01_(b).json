    "statement": "Three identical fields of size one hectare are planted with different\namounts of three kinds of wheat (types 1, 2 and 3). The first field is\ndivided in three equal parts with one type of wheat planted on each\npart. It yields 12 tons of total harvest. The second field is divided in\ntwo equal parts with type 2 planted on one part and type 3 planted on\nthe other. It yields 10 tons. The third field is divided in two equal\nparts with type 1 planted on one part and type 2 on the other. It yields\n16 tons.\n\nWrite the system you found above in augmented matrix form.",

        "Recall from\n\\href{Science:Math_Exam_Resources/Courses/MATH152/April_2011/Question_B1_(a)}{part\n(a)} that we have our linear system of the form\n\n\\[A\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{b}\\]\n\nis:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n\\frac{1}{3}  &  \\frac{1}{3}  &  \\frac{1}{3}\\\\\\\\\n0  &  \\frac{1}{2}  &  \\frac{1}{2}\\\\\\\\\n\\frac{1}{2}  &  \\frac{1}{2}  &  0\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\begin{bmatrix}\nx_1\\\\\nx_2\\\\\nx_3\\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n&=\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n12\\\\\n10\\\\\n16\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\end{align*}\n\nTherefore, we form an augmented matrix by adding the output vector\n\\textbf{b} as a new column in A.
