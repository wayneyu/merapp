        "Notice that the current source E1 is on a branch shared by current loop\n$i_1$ and $i_2$. As these currents pass through E1, $i_2$ will face up\nwhile $i_1$ will face down. We know that the difference of these\ncurrents must result in a net current of 1A upwards (since the arrow\npoints upwards). Therefore since $i_2$ is upwards then\n\n\\begin{align*}\\displaystyle{}i_2-i_1=1.\\end{align*}\n\nNotice this is equivalent to considering down is positive in which case\nthe net resulting current would be 1A up or -1A. In this case, choosing\ndown as positive we'd have $i_1-i_2=-1$ which is exactly equivalent to\nabove.\n\n\\textbf{Full Solution for Those Interested:}\n\nIf people are looking to practice there work with circuits, we can\ncontinue work from here and from\n\\href{Science:Math_Exam_Resources/Courses/MATH152/April_2011/Question_A10}{A10}\nto solve for the unknown voltages and loop currents. Based on the same\nreasoning in\n\\href{Science:Math_Exam_Resources/Courses/MATH152/April_2011/Question_A10}{A10}\nwe can get that the Kirchhoff linear equation for loop 1 is\n\n\\begin{align*}\\displaystyle{}4i_1+v_1+7(i_1-i_3)-3=0\\end{align*}\n\nwhere recall that positive numbers mean voltage drops (across the\nresistors and across the current source since it points upwards while\nour clockwise current points downwards there) and that negative numbers\nmean voltage gains (across the battery since we move from the negative\nto positive terminal). The 7$\\Omega$ resistor takes the difference in\ncurrents from loop 1 and loop 3 since it shares those loop currents.\nSimilarly we can get for loop 2\n\n\\begin{align*}\\displaystyle{}-v_1+6i_2+8(i_2-i_4)=0\\end{align*}\n\nwhere for this loop $v_1$ is a voltage gain because we are traversing\nupward, just like the arrow. We already have the third loop from\n\\href{Science:Math_Exam_Resources/Courses/MATH152/April_2011/Question_A10}{A10}\nas\n\n\\begin{align*}\\displaystyle{}9i_3+7(i_3-i_1)+v2=0\\end{align*}\n\nand so the fourth and final loop is\n\n\\begin{align*}\\displaystyle{}-v2+8(i_4-i_2)+5+10i_4\\end{align*}\n\nwhere here crossing the battery is a voltage \\textbf{drop} because we\nare going from the positive to negative terminal. So far we only have 4\nequations for 6 unknowns; the last two come from the current source.\nFrom above we already have that\n\n\\begin{align*}\\displaystyle{}i_2-i_1=1\\end{align*}\n\nand through the current source E2 we have that\n\n\\begin{align*}\\displaystyle{}i_4-i_3=2.\\end{align*}\n\nWe can write this in a matrix problem as\n\n\\begin{align*}\\begin{bmatrix}\n11  &  0  &  -7  &  0  &  1  &  0\\\\\n0  &  14  &  0  &  -8  &  -1  &  0\\\\\n-7  &  0  &  16  &  0  &  0  &  1\\\\\n0  &  -8  &  0  &  18  &  0  &  -1\\\\\n-1  &  1  &  0  &  0  &  0  &  0\\\\\n0  &  0  &  -1  &  1  &  0  &  0\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\begin{bmatrix}\ni_1\\\\\ni_2\\\\\ni_3\\\\\ni_4\\\\\nv_1\\\\\nv_2\n\\end{bmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n3\\\\\n0\\\\\n0\\\\\n-5\\\\\n1\\\\\n2\n\\end{bmatrix}.\\end{align*}\n\nWe can write this is an augmented matrix as\n\n\\begin{align*}\\left[\\begin{array}{cccccc|c}\n11  &  0  &  -7  &  0  &  1  &  0  &  3\\\\\n0  &  14  &  0  &  -8  &  -1  &  0  &  0\\\\\n-7  &  0  &  16  &  0  &  0  &  1  &  0\\\\\n0  &  -8  &  0  &  18  &  0  &  -1  &  -5\\\\\n-1  &  1  &  0  &  0  &  0  &  0  &  1\\\\\n0  &  0  &  -1  &  1  &  0  &  0  &  2\n\\end{array}\\right]\\end{align*}\n\nwhich we can row reduce to get\n\n\\begin{align*}\\left[\\begin{array}{cccccc|c}\n1  &  0  &  0  &  0  &  0  &  0  &  -0.5200\\\\\n0  &  1  &  0  &  0  &  0  &  0  &  0.4800\\\\\n0  &  0  &  1  &  0  &  0  &  0  &  -1.2000\\\\\n0  &  0  &  0  &  1  &  0  &  0  &  0.8000\\\\\n0  &  0  &  0  &  0  &  1  &  0  &  0.3200\\\\\n0  &  0  &  0  &  0  &  0  &  1  &  15.5600\n\\end{array}\\right].\\end{align*}\n\nTherefore we see that our solution is\n\n\\begin{align*}\\begin{bmatrix}\ni_1\\\\\ni_2\\\\\ni_3\\\\\ni_4\\\\\nv_1\\\\\nv_2\n\\end{bmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n -0.5200\\\\\n    0.4800\\\\\n   -1.2000\\\\\n    0.8000\\\\\n    0.3200\\\\\n   15.5600\n\\end{bmatrix}.\\end{align*}\n\nDo not worry about the presence of a negative sign, a negative loop\ncurrent just means that the current ($i_1$ and $i_3$ in this case)\nactually flows counter-clockwise, not clockwise like we assumed."
