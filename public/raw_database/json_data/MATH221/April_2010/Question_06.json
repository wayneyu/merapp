        "The answer to this statement is false. I will prove this by doing one\nexample.\n\nWe will start by letting the matrix A be:\n\n$A = \\begin{bmatrix}\n1&3&2&1\\\\\n1&0&2&1\\\\\n1&0&1&2\\\\\n1&1&1&1\\\\\n2&0&2&4\n\\end{bmatrix}$and vectors $b, c$ be\\[b = \\begin{bmatrix}\n1\\\\\n0\\\\\n1\\\\\n2\\\\\n2\\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\\] , $c = \\begin{bmatrix}\n0\\\\\n1\\\\\n3\\\\\n0\\\\\n4\n\\end{bmatrix}$ .We can also define x to be:\n\n$x = \\begin{bmatrix}\nx_{1}\\\\ \nx_{2}\\\\ \nx_{3}\\\\ \nx_{4}\n\\end{bmatrix}$Note that there are only 4 x values because there are only 4 rows in the\nmatrix $A$.We can solve the equation $Ax = b$ by doing Gaussian Elimination on the\naugmented matrix $[A|b]$:\n\n$\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 3 & 2 & 1 &|& 1 \\\\ \n1 & 0 & 2 & 1 &|& 0 \\\\ \n1 & 0 & 1 & 2 &|& 1 \\\\ \n1 & 1 & 1 & 1 &|& 2 \\\\ \n2 & 0 & 2 & 4 &|& 2 \n\\end{bmatrix}$After performing Gaussian elimination, we get the matrix in its reduced\nrow echelon form:\n\n$\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 0 & 0 & 0 &|& 4 \\\\ \n0 & 1 & 0 & 0 &|& 1/3 \\\\ \n0 & 0 & 1 & 0 &|& -5/3 \\\\ \n0 & 0 & 0 & 1 &|& -2/3 \\\\ \n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 &|& 0 \n\\end{bmatrix}$and from this we can see that $Ax = b$ does indeed have a unique\nsolution being\n\n$x = \\begin{bmatrix}\n4\\\\ \n1/3\\\\ \n-5/3\\\\ \n-2/3\n\\end{bmatrix}$We have satisfied the first argument that $Ax=b$ has a unique solution.\nNow, does $c$? We will again perform Gaussian Elimination, this time on\nthe augmented matrix $[A|c]$, to see if $Ax=c$ also has a unique\nsolution.\n\n$\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 3 & 2 & 1 &|& 0 \\\\ \n1 & 0 & 2 & 1 &|& 1 \\\\ \n1 & 0 & 1 & 2 &|& 3 \\\\ \n1 & 1 & 1 & 1 &|& 0 \\\\ \n2 & 0 & 2 & 4 &|& 4 \n\\end{bmatrix}$After performing only a few steps of Gaussian Elimination, we come to\nthe augmented matrix:\n\n$\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 3 & 2 & 1 &|& 0 \\\\ \n0 & 1 & 0 & 0 &|& -1/3 \\\\ \n0 & 0 & 1 & -1 &|& -2 \\\\ \n0 & 0 & 0 & -1 &|& -7/3 \\\\ \n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 &|& 14 \n\\end{bmatrix}$This matrix is telling us that\n$0 * x_{1} + 0 * x_{2} + 0 * x_{3} + 0 * x_{4} = 14$, but this is\nimpossible! Therefore, there are no solutions to $Ax=c$, and we reach\nthe conclusion that the answer is false."
