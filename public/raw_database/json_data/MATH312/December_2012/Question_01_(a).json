        "We seek to solve the system of congruences given by\n\n\\begin{align*}\nx &\\equiv 3 \\mod{5}\\\\\nx &\\equiv 4 \\mod{7}\\end{align*}\n\nThe first equality says that $\\displaystyle x = 3 + 5s$. Plugging into\nthe second yields $\\displaystyle 3 + 5s \\equiv 4 \\mod{7}$. Simplifying\nyields $\\displaystyle 5s \\equiv 1 \\mod{7}$.\n\nWe can find the inverse of 5 by using the Euclidean algorithm however\nsince we are modulo 7, there is only 6 possible candidates so it is\nfaster to just try them all. Since\n$\\displaystyle 5\\cdot3 \\equiv 15 \\equiv 1 \\mod{7}$, we see that\n$\\displaystyle s \\equiv 3 \\mod{7}$. This is the same as\n$\\displaystyle s = 3 + 7t$. Back substituting gives\n$\\displaystyle x = 3 + 5(3 + 7t) = 18 + 35t$. So two possible answers\nare given by 18 and 53."
