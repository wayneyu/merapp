        "To prove a statement $S(n)$ is true for all natural numbers $n$, we use\nmathematical induction which states the following:\n\n1. Prove that $P(0)$ is true\n\n2. Assume that $P(n)$ is true\n\n2. Prove that $P(n+1)$ is true (likely using information about $P(n)$\nbeing true).\n\nUpon doing this, mathematical induction states that the statement $P(n)$\nis true for all natural numbers $n$."
