        "The curves $y=x$ and $y=x^3$ intersect at the points\n$(-1,-1), \\text{ } (0,0), \\text{ } (1,1).$ By symmetry, the area of the\nregion bounded by the curves between $x=-1$ and $x=0$ is equal to the\narea of the region bounded by the curves between $x=0$ and $x=1$. So the\ntotal area will be equal to two times the area of the region between\n$x=0$ and $x=1$.\n\nBetween $x=0$ and $x=1$, we have $x \\geq x^3$; that is, the curve $y=x$\nis above the curve $y=x^3$. So the area bounded by the curves and\nbetween $x=0$ and $x=1$ is\n\n$\\int_{0}^{1} (\\text{upper} - \\text{lower}) dx = \\int_{0}^{1} (x-x^3) dx$\n\n$= \\left. \\left( \\frac{x^2}{2} - \\frac{x^4}{4} \\right) \n\\right\\vert_{0}^{1}  = \\left( \\frac{1^2}{2} - \\frac{1^4}{4} \\right) - \\left( \\frac{0}{2} - \\frac{0}{4} \\right) = \\frac{1}{4}.$\n\nThe total area of the region is two times this:\n\n$A = 2\\cdot \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{2}.$"
