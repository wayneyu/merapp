Let $f(x) = 2x^{3/5} + 3x^{-2/5}$. Note that the domain of $f$ is the\nset of all nonzero real numbers; for example, $f(-1) = -2 + 3 = 1$.\n\n(b) Find the \\emph{x}-coordinates of the local maxima and local minima\nof $f(x)$.",

        "As stated in the hint, local extrema can only occur at critical points\nthat are also points in the domain. Based on our work in part a, we have\ntwo critical points, but only $x = 1$ is in the domain. Thus, we only\nneed to check if $x = 1$ is a minimum or maximum. Here since we have a\ndecreasing function left of \\emph{1} and an increasing function right of\n\\emph{1}, we have that $x=1$ is a local minimum."
