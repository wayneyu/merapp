        "To find $y''$ we simply need to differentiate the expression\n$y' = -x^3/y^3$ from part (a). Using implicit differentiation and the\nquotient rule, we have:\n\n\\begin{align*}\ny'' &= \\frac{-3x^2(y^3) - (-x^3)3y^2y'}{(y^3)^2} \\\\\n&= \\frac{3x^2y^2(-y + xy')}{y^6} \\\\\n&= \\frac{3x^2(-y + x y')}{y^4} \\\\\n\\end{align*}"
