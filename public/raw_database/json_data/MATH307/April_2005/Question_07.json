        "We are going to work under the assumption that the two matrices are\nsimilar and use properties of similar matrices to aid us in solving this\nquestion.\n\nFor two matrices to be similar $A$ and $B$ must satisfy the equation\n$A = P^{-1}BP$\n\nThe main properties of similar matrices which we will use to verify this\nequation is that:\n\n1) Similar matrices have the same eigenvalues 2) Similar matrices have\nthe same Jordan canonical form\n\nSo, we need to get the two matrices into Jordan form and compare them.\n\nThe Jordan canonical form is given by $B = GJG^{-1}$\n\nWhere $G$ is just the matrix of eigenvectors.\n\nWe$^{\\prime}$re going to start with $B$ as it$^{\\prime}$s easy to pick\nout the eigenvalues from the diagonal, which must also be the\neigenvalues of $A$ from our known properties.\n\nEigenvalues\\[\\lambda = 1, 2, 2\\]\n\nSo let$^{\\prime}$s get our eigenvectors!\n\nYou should know how to get eigenvectors from eigenvalues (solve\n$Bx = \\lambda x$)\n\nThe eigenvectors of $B$ are:\n\n$v_{1} = \\begin{bmatrix}\n0\\\\ \n1\\\\ \n0\n\\end{bmatrix} v_{2} = \\begin{bmatrix}\n0\\\\ \n1\\\\ \n1\n\\end{bmatrix} v_{3} = \\begin{bmatrix}\n1\\\\ \n0\\\\ \n0\n\\end{bmatrix}$\n\nAnd so $G = \\begin{bmatrix}\n0 &0 &1 \\\\ \n1 & 1& 0\\\\ \n0 & 1& 0\n\\end{bmatrix}$\n\nBesides knowing the formula for obtaining the inverse of a $3$x$3$\nmatrix, one can also obtain it by $^{\\prime}$rref$^{\\prime}$-ing the\naugmented matrix:\n\n$\\begin{bmatrix}\nB\n\\left.\\begin{matrix}\n\\end{matrix}\\right|\nI\n\\end{bmatrix}$\n\nHowever you want to do it, we obtain:\n\n$G^{-1} = \\begin{bmatrix}\n0&1 &-1 \\\\ \n0&0 &1 \\\\ \n1 & 0 &0 \n\\end{bmatrix}$\n\nUsing this information we find that our J, the form we want to get, is:\n\n$J = \\begin{bmatrix}\n1 &0 &0 \\\\ \n0&2 & 0\\\\ \n0&0 &2 \n\\end{bmatrix}$\n\nNow we just do the same steps again for $A$ and then we$^{\\prime}$re\ndone!\n\nSo, $A = HJH^{-1}$, and we already know our eigenvalues as they are just\nthe same as B!\n\nThe eigenvectors of $A$ are:\n\n$u_{1} = \\begin{bmatrix}\n1\\\\ \n-1\\\\ \n1\n\\end{bmatrix} u_{2} = \\begin{bmatrix}\n-1\\\\ \n0\\\\ \n1\n\\end{bmatrix} u_{3} = \\begin{bmatrix}\n-1\\\\ \n1\\\\ \n0\n\\end{bmatrix}$\n\nAnd so $H = \\begin{bmatrix}\n1 &-1 & -1\\\\ \n-1 & 0& 1\\\\ \n1& 1& 0\n\\end{bmatrix}$ and with $H$ we obtain $H^{-1} = \\begin{bmatrix}\n1 &1 &1 \\\\ \n-1&-1 &0 \\\\ \n1& 2 &1 \n\\end{bmatrix}$\n\nWith these two matrices known we can see that:\n\n$J = \\begin{bmatrix}\n1 &0 &0 \\\\ \n0&2 & 0\\\\ \n0&0 &2 \n\\end{bmatrix}$\n\nAnd so the two matrices have the same Jordan canonical form, and are\nthus similar because of the following:\n\nWith us knowing that the two matrices have the same Jordan form we can\nshow what $P$ and $P^{-1}$ will be:\n\nif $B = GJG^{-1}$ and $A = HJH^{-1}$ then\n\n$J = G^{-1}BG$ substituting that into our other equation gets:\n\n$A = HG^{-1}BGH^{-1}$\n\nSo just let $P^{-1} = HG^{-1}$ and $P = GH^{-1}$\n\nand we get $A = P^{-1}BP$ which is what we sought out to begin with!"
