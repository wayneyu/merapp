        "Antidifferentiating gives us that\n\n$f(x) = \\frac{x^{4}}{4} + C$\n\nNow, the slope of the line $\\displaystyle x + y = 0$, which is\nequivalent to $\\displaystyle y = -x$, is -1. The point where this line\nis tangent to the curve is the \\emph{x} value where the derivative is\nequal to this slope. Thus, $\\displaystyle f'(x) = x^{3} = -1$ and so\n$\\displaystyle x = -1$. The corresponding point is at\n$\\displaystyle (-1,1/4 + C)$ which we get by plugging in our function.\nThis point must also lie on the line and thus\n\n\\begin{align*}\ny &= -x\\\\\n\\frac{1}{4} + C &= -(-1) \\\\\nC &= \\frac{3}{4}\\end{align*}\n\nThus, our desired function is\n$\\displaystyle y = \\frac{x^{4}}{4} + \\frac{3}{4}$."
