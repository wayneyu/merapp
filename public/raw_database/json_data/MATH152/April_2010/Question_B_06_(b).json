        "First pick any two linearly independent vectors lying in \\emph{P}\n(meaning the heads and tails of the vectors can be drawn in the plane\n\\emph{P}). A convenient choice will be two sides of the triangle\n\\emph{T}: \\emph{(1, 1, 5) - (0, 1, 2) = (1, 0, 3)} and \\emph{(-1, 2, 2)\n- (0, 1, 2) = (-1, 1, 0)}.\n\nA normal vector to the plane is given by the cross product of these two\nvectors (which is calculated in\n\\href{Science:Math Exam Resources/Courses/MATH152/April 2010/Question B6 (a)}{part\n(a)} already):\n\n\\begin{align*}\\vec{N} = (1,0,3) \\times (-1,1,0) = (-3,-3,1)\\end{align*}\n\nThe above vector gives the normal direction."
