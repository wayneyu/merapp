        "Using parts (a) and (c) we can see that the extrema can only occur\npossible at $\\displaystyle x=0,\\pm 2$. Since the latter two points are\nnot in the domain, we need only to check the point $\\displaystyle x=0$\nfor extrema. Looking at part (c), we see to the immediate left of 0, the\nfunction is increasing and to its immediate right the function is\ndecreasing. Thus this point is a local maximum. The coordinates are\ngiven by $\\displaystyle (0,0)$ found by plugging in 0 into the original\nfunction."
