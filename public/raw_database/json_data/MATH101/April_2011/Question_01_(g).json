So, the absolute value signs are unnecessary. Note that\n\n\\[\\sum_{n=k +1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{n^3}\\]\n\ncan be interpreted as the right Riemann sum for the integral\n\n\\[\\int_k^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{x^3} dx\\].\n\nSince $1/x^3$ is monotonically decreasing, the right Riemann sum is an\nunderestimation for the area under the curve. As step size for the\nRiemann sum $\\Delta x = 1$ is used.\n\nTherefore, we have\n\n\\[\\sum_{n=k +1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{n^3} < \\int_k^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{x^3} dx,\\]\n\nand hence it suffices to find the minimal value of $k$ such that the\nintegral above is $\\leq$ 20,000.\n\nBut the integral\n\n\\[\\int_{k}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{x^3} dx = \\left[- \\frac{1}{2x^2} \\right]_k^{\\infty} = \\frac{1}{2 k ^2}.\\]\n\nHence\n\n\\[\\sum_{n=k+1}^\\infty \\frac1{n^3} < \\int_k^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{x^3} dx = \\frac{1}{2 k^2} \\leq \\frac{1}{20000}.\\]\n\nThe minimal such $k$ is $k=100$ (in fact, for this choice of $k$, the\nright $\\leq$ becomes an $=$).\n\nTherefore we must take the first 100 terms of the sum for the\napproximation to be accurate to within 1/20000."
