    "statement": "A tank in the shape of a vertical circular cylinder 2 m high and with\nradius 0.5 m is filled with a fluid that has density $1000 kg/m^3$.\nWrite a definite integral that gives the work, in Joules, required to\npump all the fluid to the level of the top of the tank. For acceleration\ndue to gravity, use $g = 9.8 m/s^2$. Do not evaluate the integral.",

        "To solve this problem, we consider moving up the liquid in the cylinder\nslice by slice.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htbp]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=.5\\textwidth]{Math_Exam_Resources_Courses_MATH101_April_2011_Question_3_(a)_picture_1.jpg}\n\\caption{Math\\_Exam\\_Resources\\_Courses\\_MATH101\\_April\\_2011\\_Question\\_3\\_(a)\\_picture\\_1.jpg}\n\\end{figure}\n\nConsider the slice of the cylinder of height \\emph{dx} as in the\npicture. Its volume is given by \\emph{A} \\emph{dx} where \\emph{a} is the\narea of the disc. This is\n\n\\[\\pi (0.5)^2\\,dx\\] Its mass is thus\n\n\\[1000 \\pi (0.5)^2 \\,dx = 250 \\pi \\,dx\\] Since the density of the liquid\nis 1000 kg/m\\textsuperscript{3}. The work to lift the slice to the top\nis \\emph{force} multiplied by \\emph{distance} which is\n\n\\[9.8 \\cdot 250 \\pi \\,dx \\cdot x = 9.8 \\cdot 250 \\pi x \\,dx\\] where\n\\emph{x} is the distance from the top of the cylinder to the slice.\n\nHence the total work is given by integrating this from the top to the\nbottom of the cylinder, that is from 0 to 2 and we obtain the integral\n\n\\[W = \\int_0^2 9.8 \\cdot 250 \\pi x \\,dx\\]"
