Your graph should have\none of these features at \\emph{x = 2}.\n\nIn our example below the function switches from concave up to concave\ndown at \\emph{x = 1} and has a maximum at \\emph{x = 2}.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htbp]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=.5\\textwidth]{Crit_and_inflect.jpg}\n\\caption{Crit and inflect.jpg}\n\\end{figure}"

        "Recall that at an inflection point the function switches concavity (but\ndoes not necessarily switch from increasing to decreasing or decreasing\nto increasing); at a critical point, the slope of the function is zero\n(often a maximum or minimum) or the derivative doesn't exist."
