How many equations does this\nprovide?",

        "For $\\displaystyle f(x)$ to have continuous first derivatives, we must\nhave $\\displaystyle p_i'(x_{i+1}) = p_{i+1}'(x_{i+1})$ . This gives us\nN-2 equations because we cannot fit the endpoints to anything.\n\nFor $\\displaystyle f(x)$ to have continuous second derivatives, we must\nhave $\\displaystyle p_{i}''(x_{i+1}) = p_{i+1}''(x_{i+1})$ . This gives\nus N-2 equations because again, we cannot fit the endpoints to anything.\n\nSo in total, $\\displaystyle (N-2) + (N-2) = 2N - 4$ equations"
