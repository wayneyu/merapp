        "Recall the Maclaurin (power) series of sin(\\emph{x}) is\n\n\\[\\sin (x) = x - \\frac{x^3}{3!} + \\frac{x^5}{5!} - \\frac{x^7}{7!} + \\dots\\]\n\nNote that the first two terms cancel exactly with the polynomial in the\nnumerator. Thus,\n\n\\begin{align*}\n \\lim_{x\\rightarrow0}\\frac{\\sin (x)-x+x^{3}/6}{\\sin (x^5)} &=\\lim_{x\\rightarrow0}\\frac{x^{5}/(5!)-x^{7}/(7!)+\\cdots}{\\sin (x^5)} \\\\\n&= \\lim_{x \\to 0} \\left( \\frac{1}{5!}\\frac{x^5}{\\sin (x^5)} - \\frac{x^2}{7!}\\frac{x^5}{\\sin (x^5)} + \\dots  \\right) \n\\end{align*}\n\nNow, as shown in Hint 2,\n\n\\[\\lim_{x \\to 0} \\frac{y}{\\sin (y)} = 1\\]\n\nwe can also say that\n\n\\[\\lim_{x\\rightarrow0}\\frac{x^5}{\\sin (x^5)}=1\\]\n\nSo the first term of the limit becomes $\\frac{1}{5!}$. The remaining\nterms all have an $x^5 / \\sin(x^5)$ term which evaluates to $1$, but\nalso have an extra power of $x$ which will make the entire term go to\n\\emph{0}. So the solution to the limit is $\\frac{1}{5!}$.\n\nThis question demonstrates the strength of power series in more\ndifficult calculus problems."

        "At first one might think that L'Hopital's Rule would be a good strategy\nbecause evaluating the limit at zero gives an indeterminate form.\nHowever, taking the derivative of the denominator involves the chain\nrule, which will not help simplify the problem. Instead, try using a\npower series expansion of $\\sin x$ in the numerator.", 
        "Once you have simplified the expression inside the limit using Hint 1,\nit is useful to recall the following known limit:\n\n\\[\\lim_{y\\rightarrow0}\\frac{y}{\\sin y}=1\\]\n\nwhere $y~$ can be replaced by any continuous function $y=f(x)~$ whenever\n$\\lim_{x\\rightarrow0}f(x)=0$. For example\\[y=x^5~.\\]"
