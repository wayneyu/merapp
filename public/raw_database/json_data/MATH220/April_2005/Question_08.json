        "We can show that the sequence ${b_n}$ is Cauchy. Let \u03b5 \\textgreater{} 0,\nthen if \\emph{n} and \\emph{m} are larger than 1/(2\u03b5) (that's the value\nof \\emph{N}, you can see from the argument below how we might have\nguessed it), then if \\emph{m} $\\geq$ \\emph{n}, we have that\n\n\\begin{align*}\\displaystyle\n| b_m - b_n | < \\frac{1}{m+n} \\leq \\frac{1}{2n} < \\epsilon\\end{align*}\n\nAnd since Cauchy sequences of real numbers are always convergent, we\nknow that the limit of this sequence exists."

        "Have you heard of\n\\href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cauchy_sequence}{Cauchy sequences}?\nTry seeing if the sequence is Cauchy. If you haven't, first see if you\nshould (the curriculum might have changed since 2005)."
