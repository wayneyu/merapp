        "A matrix is diagonalizable if you can find a basis of eigenvectors, here\nthat means we look for three linearly independent eigenvectors.\n\nTo find eigenvectors, we first need to find eigenvalues. For this, we\ncompute the characteristic polynomial:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n\\det(A-\\lambda I) &= \\left| \\begin{array}{ccc}\n2-\\lambda & 0 & 0 \\\\\n1 & -\\lambda & -1 \\\\\n-1 & 2 & 3-\\lambda \\end{array} \\right| \\\\\n&= (2-\\lambda)((-\\lambda)(3-\\lambda) +2) \\\\\n&= (2-\\lambda)(\\lambda^2-3\\lambda+2) \\\\\n&= (2-\\lambda)(\\lambda-2)(\\lambda-1) \\\\\n&= -(\\lambda-2)^2(\\lambda-1)\\end{align*} And so \\emph{A} has the eigenvalues 1 and 2. We now employ\ntwo facts about eigenvectors:\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\itemsep1pt\\parskip0pt\\parsep0pt\n\\item\n  The eigenvectors of distinct eigenvalues are linearly independent.\n\\item\n  The number of linearly independent eigenvector for a given eigenvalue\n  (= dimension of the eigenspace = geometric multiplicity) is between 1\n  and the algebraic multiplicity of that eigenvalue.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\nRecall that the algebraic multiplicity corresponds to the exponent in\nthe characteristic polynomial:\n\n\\begin{align*}\\det(A-\\lambda I)  = -(\\lambda-2)^{\\color{red} 2}(\\lambda-1)^{\\color{blue}1}\\end{align*}\n\nmeans that the algebraic multiplicity of the eigenvalue 2 is two, and of\nthe eigenvalue 1 is one.\n\nWith this we conclude that\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\itemsep1pt\\parskip0pt\\parsep0pt\n\\item\n  There is exactly one eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue 1,\n  and it is linearly independent from any eigenvector corresponding to\n  the eigenvalue 2.\n\\item\n  There is either one or two eigenvectors corresponding to the\n  eigenvalue 2. We can find out how many by calculating the dimension of\n  the eigenspace.\n\\item\n  If the dimension of the eigenspace corresponding to the eigenvector 2\n  is two, then there are three linearly independent eigenvectors and\n  \\emph{A} is diagonalizable. If the dimension is only one, then\n  \\emph{A} has only two linearly independent eigenvectors and is not\n  diagonalizable.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\nHence, we only need to find the dimension of that eigenspace. Since that\neigenspace is the nullspace of the matrix \\emph{A} - 2\\emph{I}, we\nsimply compute the rank of that matrix:\n\n\\begin{align*}\nA-2I &= \\left[ \\begin{array}{ccc}\n0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n1 & -2 & -1 \\\\\n-1 & 2 & 1 \\end{array} \\right] \\\\\n&\\sim \\left[ \\begin{array}{ccc}\n1 & -2 & -1 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 \\end{array} \\right] \\end{align*} And since the rank is 1 this eigenspace will be of\ndimension 2. Therefore matrix \\emph{A} is diagonalizable."
