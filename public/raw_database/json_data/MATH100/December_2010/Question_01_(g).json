        "First, we must find the derivative of the curve using implicit\ndifferentiation:\n\n\\begin{align*}\nx^4-x^2y+y^4 &=1\\\\\n(x^4-x^2y+y^4)'&=(1)'\\\\\n4x^3-(x^2y)'+4y^3y'&=0\\\\\n4x^3-x^2y'-2xy+4y^3y'&=0\\\\\ny'(-x^2+4y^3)&=2xy-4x^3\\\\\ny'&=\\frac{2xy-4x^3}{4y^3-x^2}\\end{align*} This gives us the equation for the slope. The question is\nasking us for the slope at the point (-1,1) so we plug in x=-1 and y=1:\n\n\\begin{align*}\ny'&=\\frac{2xy-4x^3}{4y^3-x^2}\\\\\n&=\\frac{2(-1)(1)-4(-1)^3}{4(1)^3-(-1)^2}\\\\\n&=\\frac{-2+4}{4-1}\\\\\n&=\\frac{2}{3}\\end{align*} Therefore, the slope of the tangent line to the curve at\n(-1,1) is 2/3."
