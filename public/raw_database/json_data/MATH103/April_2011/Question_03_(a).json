If we were to put a very large positive value of <span class=\"math\">\\(x\\)</span> into <span class=\"math\">\\(f(x)\\)</span> we would get that</p>\n<p><span class=\"math\">\\[\\begin{aligned}\nf(x)=x(x-2)(x+1)\\approx{}x^3\\end{aligned}\\]</span></p>\n<p>since adding or subtracting numbers to something large is unaffected.
