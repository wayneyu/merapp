        "Recall that $n\\times{n}$ matrices have n eigenvalues. Here since n=2 we\nhave 2 eigenvalues which are given as 2 and 3. Also recall that if A is\nnot invertible then there exists at least one non-zero vector \\textbf{x}\nsuch that A\\textbf{x}=0. Therefore, we see that if A is not invertible\nthen there is at least one zero eigenvalue with eigenvector \\textbf{x}.\nConversely, if 0 is an eigenvalue then there exists a non-zero vector\n\\textbf{x} such that A\\textbf{x}=0 which means A is not invertible. This\nconcludes that A being non-invertible implies a zero eigenvalue and also\nthat a zero eigenvalue implies that A is non-invertible. We just wrote\nthat the only eigenvalues are 2 and 3 so therefore, 0 is not an\neigenvalues which means A must be invertible."
