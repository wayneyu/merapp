    "statement": "Suppose you expanded the same function \\emph{$f$(x) = x} as in\n\\href{Science:Math_Exam_Resources/Courses/MATH307/December_2010/Question_06_(a)}{part\n(a)} except on the interval $0 \\leq x \\leq 2$. What would be the\n\\emph{form} (i.e., do not compute the coefficients) of the Fourier\nseries valid for this interval? What points on the plane would you plot\nto produce a frequency-amplitude plot from this new Fourier series?\n(Give the answer in terms of the coefficients in the new expansion.)",

        "If we extend the domain from (0,1) to (0,2), the frequency will chenge.\nOur original frequency was $\\omega_n=\\frac{n}{T}$ where T was 1. Now T\nis 2 since interval has increased. Thus, new $\\omega_n=\\frac{n}{2}$.\nHowever, the amplitude will not change.\n\n$c_{n} = \\int_{0}^{1} e^{-2\\pi inx}f(x)dx= \\frac{1}{2}\\int_{0}^{2} e^{-2\\pi \\frac{inx}{2}}f(x)dx$\n\nAs a result, new $c_n$ will be halved, but bigger range of integration\nwill put the value back increased by 2 again. Thus, amplitude is equal.\nAlthough, $c_0$ is different.\n\n$c_{0} = \\frac{1}{2}\\int_{0}^{2} f(x)dx=\\frac{1}{2}\\left [\\frac{1}{2}x^2 \\right ]^2_0=1$\n\nThus new frequency-amplitude plot will be (0,1) and\n$\\left(\\frac{n}{2},|c_n|\\right)$"
