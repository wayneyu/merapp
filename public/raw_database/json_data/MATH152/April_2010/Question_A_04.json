        "Recall the conditions for a unique solution, no solution and an infinite\nnumber of solutions. For a unique solution, the row reduced matrix must\nbe the identity matrix so that each unknown has precisely one determined\nvalue (hence unique). For no solutions to occur we need either a\ncontradiction (i.e. trying to determine that an unknown takes on two\nvalues) or we need an impossible situation (i.e. trying to determine\nthat 0x=7). For an infinite number of solutions we need a free variable\nin the form 0z=0.\n\nWe have 4 equations and 3 unknowns so our matrix is $4\\times{3}$. We are\ntrying to determine three variables with 4 conditions. Recall that to\ndetermine n unknowns we need exactly n equations (i.e. we only need 3\nconditions here). Therefore, the only way we will get a unique solution\nis if one of the equations is redundant information (so that in\nactuality we only have 3 conditions). This would appear in the matrix as\na row of zeros (since one row will be a multiple of another). For\nexample, consider a system row reduced as follows\n\n\\begin{align*}\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc|c}\n1  &  0  &  0 & 7\\\\\n0  & 1  &  0  &  2\\\\\n0  &  0  &  1  & 4\\\\\n0  &  0  &  0  &  0\n\\end{array}\\right].\\end{align*}\n\nIf we call our unknowns, x,y, and z then we see that x=7, y=2, z=4 and\nthen the last row tells us 0x+0y+0z=0 which holds true and so we have a\n\\textbf{unique} solution.\n\nIf the 4th condition was not simply redundant information but rather a\nindependent condition then we could row reduce to get something of the\nform\n\n\\begin{align*}\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc|c}\n1  &  0  &  0 & 7\\\\\n0  & 1  &  0  &  2\\\\\n0  &  0  &  1  & 4\\\\\n0  &  0  &  0  &  12\n\\end{array}\\right].\\end{align*}\n\nHere we still are determining that x=7, y=2, and z=4 but we also require\nthat 0x+0y+0z=12 which doesn't hold true for these values (in fact it\nwill never hold true) and therefore all 4 conditions can't be satisfied\nso this results in \\textbf{no solution}.\n\nWe have considered when there is no redundancy in the constraints and\nwhen one condition is redundant. What if multiple conditions are\nredundant? Let's say we have a model with the following constraints\n\n\\begin{align*}\n1 x + 2 y + 3 z &=5 \\\\\n1 x + 3 y + 6 z &=2 \\\\\n2 x + 4 y + 8 z &=10 \\\\\n3 x + 6 y + 12 z &=15.\\end{align*}\n\nNotice that equation 3 is just 2 times equation 1 and equation 4 is 3\ntimes equation 1. Therefore, really 3 of the four equations are just\nsaying that 1\\emph{x}+2\\emph{y}+3\\emph{z}=5. The row reduced matrix\nwould be\n\n\\begin{align*}\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc|c}\n1  &  0  &  0 & 11\\\\\n0  & 1  &  2  &  -3\\\\\n0  &  0  &  0  & 0\\\\\n0  &  0  &  0  &  0\n\\end{array}\\right].\\end{align*}\n\nIn this example we have a free variable because we only have 2 pivots.\nTherefore let \\emph{z}=\\emph{t}. Then we conclude that\n\n\\begin{align*}\nx&=11\\\\\ny&=-3-2z=-3-2t\\\\\nz&=t\\end{align*}\n\nor\n\n\\begin{align*}\\begin{bmatrix}\nx\\\\\ny\\\\\nz\n\\end{bmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n11\\\\\n-3\\\\\n0\n\\end{bmatrix}\n+t\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n0\\\\\n-2\\\\\n1\n\\end{bmatrix}.\\end{align*}\n\nHere we see that there are actually an \\textbf{infinite number of\nsolutions} depending on the parameter \\emph{t}.\n\nTherefore we have constructed examples where we can have \\textbf{unique\nsolutions}, \\textbf{no solutions}, or an \\textbf{infinite number of\nsolutions} and thus we see the answer is \\textbf{(e)}"
