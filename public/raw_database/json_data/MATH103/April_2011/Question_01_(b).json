        "The first 3 can easily be deduced just by looking at the pictures.\n\n1. The pdf with the smallest mean is (1).\n\n2. The pdf with the largest variance is (4).\n\n3. The pdf with the smallest standard deviation is (3).\n\n4. The pdf with median larger than the mean is (2).\n\nBy symmetry, both graphs (3) and (4) have the same mean and median. To\ndecide between (1) and (2), we can compute the mean and median directly\nfor (2). We can do this in the simple case where $a=0$ and $b=1$. Then\n$p(x)=Cx$ for some constant $C$. Since\n$1=\\int_0^1 p(x)\\, dx = C \\int_0^1 x\\, dx = \\frac{C}{2}$, $C=2.$ The\nmean is then $\\int_0^1 x p(x)\\, dx = 2\\int_0^1 x^2\\, dx  = \\frac23.$ The\nmedian $m$ is determined by\n$\\frac12=\\int_0^m p(x)\\, dx =  \\int_0^m 2x\\, dx = m^2$, hence,\n$m = \\frac1{\\sqrt{2}},$ which is larger than $\\frac23.$\n\n5. The total area under the graph must be 1. Note that the area of a\ntriangle is equal to half of its base length times its height; both\ntriangles have the same area, with base length $\\frac{b-a}2$ and height\n$y$. Therefore,\n\n\\begin{align*}\n1=2\\cdot\\frac12\\left(\\frac{b-a}2\\right) y = \\frac12(b-a) y,\\end{align*}\n\nwhere $y$ is the maximal probability density.\n\nHence,\n\n\\begin{align*}y = \\frac{2}{b-a}.\\end{align*}"
