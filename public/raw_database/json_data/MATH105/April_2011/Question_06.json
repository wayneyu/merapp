    "statement": "A certain T-shirt company makes two types of shirts. Type A says ``Much\nMusic rocks'' while Type B says ``Business Calculus rocks''. The company\nproduces 1000 T-shirts in total every year. It sells each Type A shirt\nat \\$15 and each Type B shirt at \\$10. If the cost of producing $x$\nshirts of Type A and $y$ shirts of Type B is\n\n\\[C = \\frac{1}{200} x^2 + 6x + 4y + 4000,\\]\n\ndetermine how many shirts of each kind the company should produce to\nmaximize its profit every year. Give a simple justification why the\nanswer you obtained gives the maximum and not the minimum.",

        "We already have given the cost function\n\n\\[C(x,y) = \\frac{1}{200}x^2 + 6x + 4y + 4000\\]\n\nSince we sell $x$ T-Shirts of type A for \\$15 each and $y$ T-Shirts of\ntype B for \\$10 each, the revenue must be given by\n\n\\[\\displaystyle\nR(x,y) = 15x + 10y\\]\n\nThe profit is by definition given by the formula\n\n\\begin{align*}\nP(x,y) &= R(x,y) - C(x,y) \\\\\n &= 15x + 10y - (\\frac{1}{200}x^2 + 6x + 4y + 4000) \\\\\n &= - \\frac{1}{200}x^2 + 9x + 6y - 4000\n\\end{align*}\n\nThere are essentially two ways of solving the problem. Let us describe\nboth in full detail.\n\n\\textbf{Solution via Lagrange Multiplier.} The fact that the company\nonly produces 1000 T-Shirts is reflected in the \\emph{constraint\nequation} $x + y = 1000$. Thus, the constraint function is given by\n\n\\[\\displaystyle{}\ng(x,y) = x+y-1000\\]\n\nand the constraint translates into $g(x,y) = 0$. The \\emph{objective\nfunction} is the profit function $P(x,y)$. We have\n\n\\begin{align*}\nP_x &= -\\frac{1}{100}x+9,\\\\\nP_y &= 6\n\\end{align*} as well as\n\n\\[\\displaystyle{}g_x = g_y = 1.\\]\n\nThus, for the Lagrange equation in $y$,\n\n\\begin{align*}\nP_y &= \\lambda \\cdot g_y\\\\\n6 &=\\lambda\n\\end{align*}\n\nand for the Lagrange equation in $x$,\n\n\\begin{align*}\nP_x &= \\lambda \\cdot g_x\\\\\n-\\frac{1}{100}x + 9 &= \\lambda = 6.\n\\end{align*}\n\nWe can solve these Lagrange equations to get $x = 300$. Since we also\nmust have $g(x,y) = x+y-1000 = 0$ we get $y = 700$ as the unique\nsolution of the Lagrange multiplier problem. The profit we make is\n$P(300,700) = 2450$. That this is really a maximum and not a minimum can\nbe shown be computing the profit of another distribution of T-Shirts.\nFor instance $x = 0$ and $y=1000$ yields $P(0,1000) = 2000$. This\nargument works because we only have one global extremum under the\nconstraint $g(x,y) = 0$.\n\n\\textbf{Solution without Lagrange Multipliers.} The question does not\nstate that we have to use Lagrange Multipliers to solve this problem. We\ncan use the following solution as well. First, we solve the constraint\nequation $x+y=1000$ for either $x$ or $y$. Since the profit function is\nquadratic in $x$ and only linear in $y$ we should solve the constraint\nequation for $y$ to make life simpler. We get $y = 1000 - x$. We replace\n$y$ by this expression in the profit function. This results in\n\n\\begin{align*}\nP &= - \\frac{1}{200}x^2 + 9x + 6y - 4000 \\\\\n&= -\\frac{1}{200}x^2 + 9x + 6(1000 - x) - 4000 \\\\\n&= -\\frac{1}{200}x^2 + 9x + 6000 - 6x - 4000 \\\\\n&= -\\frac{1}{200}x^2 + 3x + 2000\n\\end{align*}\n\nNow the profit is transformed into a function in just $x$ and we can use\nmethods of differential calculus learned in MATH 104 or 184 to find the\nglobal maximum. First we see that $P$ describes a parabola. Since the\nsign in front of the quadratic term is negative, the focal point of the\nparabola must be the maximum which is the only critical point of $P$.\nThus, it is enough to find the zeros of $P'(x)$. We have\n$P'(x) = -1/100 \\cdot x + 3$ and this equals to zero only for $x = 300$.\nSince $y = 1000-x$ we must have $y = 700$.\n\n\\textbf{Important Remark.} If the question does not clearly mention a\nspecific method you have to apply to solve the problem, it is your\nchoice which method you use. Some students find the Lagrange Multiplier\nsolution simpler, some not. Decide based on your strengths!"
