        "As given in the original statement, the function has domain of all\nnonzero reals. The function itself is only not continuous at 0 so we\ncheck there for an asymptote.\n\nThe value\n\n\\begin{align*}\n\\lim_{x \\to 0^{+}}(2x^{3/5} + 3x^{-2/5}) = \\infty\n\\end{align*} since this function when we plug in values of \\emph{x}\nslightly bigger than 0, the first term tends to 0 and the second term\ntends to positive infinity.\n\nNotice that the left hand limit is also positive infinity since the\nsecond term can be written as\n$\\displaystyle 3x^{-2/5} = \\frac{3}{\\sqrt[5]{x^2}}$ which is always\npositive."
