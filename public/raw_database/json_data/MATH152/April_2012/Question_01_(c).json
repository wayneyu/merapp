        "From\n\\href{Science:Math_Exam_Resources/Courses/MATH152/April_2012/Question_1_(b)}{1(b)}\nwe saw that the system of equations the line must satisfy is given by\n\n\\begin{align*}\n2x_1+x_2-x_3&=1\\\\\nx_1+x_2&=1.\n\\end{align*}\n\nIn order to find the parametric form we solve this system. First we put\nit in augmented form\n\n\\[\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc|c}\n2  &  1  &  -1  &  1\\\\\n1  &  1  &  0  &  1\n\\end{array}\\right]\\]\n\nand then perform row operations to reduce the matrix. First we will swap\nrow 1 and row 2 so that the first pivot (row 1, column 1) has value 1.\n\n\\[\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc|c}\n1  &  1  &  0  &  1\\\\\n2  &  1  &  -1  &  1\n\\end{array}\\right]\\]\n\nand then we will subtract 2 multiples of row 1 from row 2 to place a\nzero below the pivot,\n\n\\[\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc|c}\n1  &  1  &  0  &  1\\\\\n0  &  -1  &  -1  &  -1\n\\end{array}\\right].\\]\n\nWe will then multiply the second row by -1 to put a 1 in the pivot\nposition there (row 2, column 2),\n\n\\[\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc|c}\n1  &  1  &  0  &  1\\\\\n0  &  1  &  1  &  1\n\\end{array}\\right]\\]\n\nand finally we will subtract 1 multiple of row 2 from row 1 to put a 0\nabove the pivot,\n\n\\[\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc|c}\n1  &  0  &  -1  &  0\\\\\n0  &  1  &  1  &  1\n\\end{array}\\right].\\]\n\nNotice that because we have more columns than rows, then we have a free\nvariables (the matrix is rank deficient). Let the free variable be\n$x_3$, i.e. let $x_3=t$. Then from our reduced matrix problem we have\nthat $x_1=t$ and that $x_2+t=1$ or $x_2=1-t$. Therefore we can write\nthat\n\n\\[\\begin{bmatrix}\nx_1\\\\\nx_2\\\\\nx_3\n\\end{bmatrix}=\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n0\\\\\n1\\\\\n0\n\\end{bmatrix}+\nt\\begin{bmatrix}\n1\\\\\n-1\\\\\n1\n\\end{bmatrix}.\\]\n\nThis parametrically describes the line.", 
        "From\n\\href{Science:Math_Exam_Resources/Courses/MATH152/April_2012/Question_1_(a)}{1(a)}\nwe have that the normal directions to the two planes are\n\n\\begin{align*}\n\\mathbf{n}&=[2,1,-1]\\\\\n\\mathbf{m}&=[1,1,0]\n\\end{align*}\n\nWe know that the line must lie on both planes and therefore the\ndirection of the line must be orthogonal to both normals. Therefore we\ncan find it by taking the cross product,\n\n\\[\\mathbf{n}\\times\\mathbf{m}=[2,1,-1]\\times[1,1,0]=\\textrm{det}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\mathbf{i}  &  \\mathbf{j}  &  \\mathbf{k}\\\\\n2  &  1  &  -1\\\\\n1  &  1  &  0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n=[1,-1,1].\\]\n\nWe then must identify a point on the line. To do this we attempt to find\none of the intercepts with the coordinate planes (one of $x_1$, $x_2$,\nor $x_3$ being zero). Set $x_1$ to be zero, from the plane equation for\n$S_2$, this tells us that $x_2=1$. Then using the plean equation for\n$S_1$, we get that $x_3=0$. Therefore, the point $(0,1,0)$ is on the\nline. This tells us that we can write the equation of the line as\n\n$\\begin{bmatrix}\nx_1\\\\\nx_2\\\\\nx_3\n\\end{bmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n0\\\\\n1\\\\\n0\n\\end{bmatrix}\n+\nt\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1\\\\\n-1\\\\\n1\n\\end{bmatrix}$\n\nwhich is the parametric equation of the line."
