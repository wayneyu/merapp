        "The x-intercepts of $f(x)$ are all points of the form $(a, 0)$, that is,\nall points where $y = 0$. To find these x-values, we simply set the\nfunction $f(x) = 0$ and solve for $x$.\n\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{x+1}{x-1}&= 0 \\\\\nx + 1 &= 0 \\\\\nx &= -1 \\end{align*}\n\nSo $f(x)$ has an x-intercept at $(-1, 0)$.\n\nThe y-intercept of $f(x)$ is the point of the form $(0, b)$, that is,\nwhere $x = 0$. To find the y-intercept therefore, we simply plug $x = 0$\ninto the function to find the y-value.\n\n$f(0) = \\frac{0+1}{0-1} = \\frac{1}{-1} = -1$\n\nSo the y-intercept is $(0, -1)$."
