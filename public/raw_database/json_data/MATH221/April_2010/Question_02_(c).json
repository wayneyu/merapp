        "To find a vector orthogonal to all of u1, u2, u3, we must find a vector\nwhose dot product with each of u1, u2, u3 is 0. Similar to part b), we\ncan arrange u1, u2, u3 in a matrix.\n\nM = $\\begin{bmatrix}u1 & u2 & u3\n\n\\end{bmatrix}$ = $\\begin{bmatrix}\n0 & 1 & 2\\\\ \n2 & -2 & 0\\\\ \n1 & 0 & 2\\\\\n2 & 2 & -1\n\\end{bmatrix}$To find the vector we are looking for, we can solve for the null space\nof the transpose of M. This will satisfy the constraint that the dot\nproduct of the vector u4 and each of u1, u2, u3 is 0.\n\nSo we solve\\[M^{T}\\] * u4 = $\\begin{bmatrix}\n\n0\\\\\n\n0\\\\\n\n0\n\n\\end{bmatrix}$This gives us: u4 = $\\begin{bmatrix}\n\n-2/3\\\\\n\n-1/3\\\\\n\n2/3\\\\\n\n0\n\n\\end{bmatrix}$"
