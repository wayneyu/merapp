        "As long as $N''(t)$ is negative, $N'(t)$ is decreasing. Differentiating\n$N(t),$\n\n\\[N'(t) = 60t-3t^2\\] Differentiating again,\n\n\\[N''(t) = 60-6t.\\] This is negative whenever $6t>60,$ i.e. $t>10.$ We\ncan conclude that $N'(t)$ is decreasing for all $t>10.$\n\n\\emph{(Furthermore, $N'(t)$ is continuous, we also know that it is\nincreasing on the closed interval, $[10,\\infty)$. On an exam, either\nanswer, $(10,\\infty)$ or $[10,\\infty)$, would be acceptable.)}"
