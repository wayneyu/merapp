        "A picture can be found below.\n\nFirst, we find the points of intersection. Set the curves equal to each\nother so that\n\n$\\displaystyle  4 - x^{2} = 2-x$\n\nThen isolating to one side gives\n\n$\\displaystyle  0 = x^{2}-x-2 = (x+1)(x-2)$\n\nand so the \\emph{x} coordinates of the points of intersection are\n$x=-1,2$. Now, plugging in the point $x=0$ into both curves shows that\n$4-x^{2}$ is the upper most curve. Hence, the area we seek is\n\n\\begin{align*}\nA &= \\int_{-1}^{2}(4-x^{2} - (2-x))\\, dx \\\\\n&= \\int_{-1}^{2}(-x^{2} +x +2)\\, dx \\\\\n&= \\left. \\left(\\frac{-x^{3}}{3} + \\frac{x^{2}}{2} + 2x \\right)\\right|_{-1}^{2} \\\\\n&=  \\left(\\frac{-8}{3} + \\frac{4}{2} + 2(2) \\right) - \\left(\\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{2} + 2(-1) \\right) \\\\\n&=  \\frac{-8}{3} + 6 -\\frac{1}{3} - \\frac{1}{2} + 2 \\\\\n&=  -3 +\\frac{15}{2} \\\\\n&=  \\frac{9}{2} \n\\end{align*}\n\ncompleting the question.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htbp]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=.5\\textwidth]{MATH101Apr2005Q2aNew.jpeg}\n\\caption{MATH101Apr2005Q2aNew.jpeg}\n\\end{figure}"
