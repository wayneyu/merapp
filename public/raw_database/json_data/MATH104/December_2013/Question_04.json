    "statement": "A rectangular storage container with an open top is to have volume of 8\ncubic metres. The length of its base is twice the width. Material for\nthe base costs \\$4.50 per square metre, and material for the sides costs\n\\$6 per square metre. Find the cost of the material for the cheapest\nsuch container.",

        "We wish to \\emph{minimize} the \\textbf{cost}, C, subject to the\nconstraint that the volume of the container must be\n$V = 8 \\text{m}^{3}$. The cost C can be expressed as the sum of the\ncosts for all the sides. Recall that this is an open-top box (i.e., no\ntop). If we let \\emph{l}, \\emph{w}, and \\emph{h} denote the length,\nwidth, and height of the box in metres, respectively, then:\n\n\\begin{align*}\nC &= C_{\\text{sides}} + C_{\\text{bottom}} \\\\\n&= 6 (2hw + 2hl) + 4.5(lw)\\end{align*}\n\nsince material for the base costs \\$4.50 per square metre, and material\nfor the sides costs \\$6 per square metre.\n\nWe are also given the constraint\n\n\\begin{align*}\\displaystyle V = lwh = 8\\end{align*} Using the fact that the length is twice\nthe width (i.e., \\emph{l = 2w}), the cost function and volume constraint\nare expressed as\n\n\\begin{align*}\\displaystyle C = 36hw + 9w^{2}, \\quad V = 2w^{2}h = 8\\end{align*}\n\nTo reduce this into a single variable problem, we use the constraint to\nexpress the \\emph{height} of the box \\emph{in terms of the width}:\n\n\\begin{align*}h = \\frac{4}{w^{2}},\\end{align*} and substitute this into the cost function\n\\emph{C}, making it a function of \\emph{w} only:\n\n\\begin{align*}C(w) = \\frac{144}{w} + 9w^{2}\\end{align*}\n\nTo optimize C, we determine first determine its critical points by\ndifferentiating with respect to \\emph{w} and setting the derivative\nequal to zero:\n\n\\begin{align*}\nC'(w) &= -\\frac{144}{w^{2}} + 18w \\\\\n0 &= -\\frac{144}{w^{2}} + 18w \\\\\n144 &= 18w^3 \\\\\n8 &= w^3 \\\\\nw &= 2\\end{align*}\n\nTherefore \\emph{w} = 2 is a critical point. To determine whether or not\nit is the point that minimizes \\emph{C}, we use the \\textbf{second\nderivative test}. The second derivative of C with respect to w is\n\n\\begin{align*}C''(w) = \\frac{288}{w^{3}} + 18\\end{align*} which is clearly greater than zero\nwhen \\emph{w} = 2. Thus, by the second derivative test, \\emph{C} has a\nlocal minimum at \\emph{w} = 2 (Moreover, it is the \\emph{global minimum}\nsince there are no other critical points.) Substituting \\emph{w} = 2\ninto the cost function, we determine that the minimum cost is\n\n\\begin{align*}C(2) = \\frac{144}{2} + 9(2)^{2} = 72 + 36 = {\\color{blue}$108}\\end{align*}"
