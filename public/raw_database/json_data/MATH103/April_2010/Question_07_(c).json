        "The median \\emph{t\\textsubscript{med}} is defined as\n\n\\[F(t_\\text{med}) = \\frac12\\]\n\nSince \\emph{F(t)} is given we can easily calculate that\n\n\\[\\frac12 = F(t_\\text{med}) = 1-e^{-t_\\text{med}/12}, \\quad\u00c2\u00a0\\text{i.e.} \\quad e^{-t_\\text{med}/12} = \\frac12.\\]\n\nAfter cross multiplying we get $\\displaystyle e^{t_\\text{med}/12} = 2.$\nTaking the logarithm \\emph{ln(x)} on both sides yields the final answer\n\n\\[t_\\text{med} = 12\\ln(2).\\]\n\n\\emph{Note: From the class notes you may remember that the median\nwaiting time is given by ln(2)/k. Here k=1/12, see part (a), so our\ncalculated answer agrees with the answer we expected.}"
