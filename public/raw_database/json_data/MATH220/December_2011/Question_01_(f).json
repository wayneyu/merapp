        "Strong mathematical induction is a method to prove a statement\n\\emph{S}(\\emph{n}) is true for all natural numbers \\emph{n}. It is given\nby the following.\n\nSuppose that for every natural number \\emph{n}, that we have the\nimplication\n\n\\begin{align*}\\big(\\forall\\,k < n, S(k)\\big) \\Rightarrow S(n)\\end{align*}\n\nThen for every natural number \\emph{n}, the statement \\emph{S}(\\emph{n})\nis true."
