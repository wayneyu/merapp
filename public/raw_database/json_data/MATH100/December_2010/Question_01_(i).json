        "Let \\emph{$f$} (x)=x\\textsuperscript{1/3}. First we need a number \\emph{a}\n~as close to 30 as possible but whose cube root we know. A good\ncandidate would be 27, because 3\\textsuperscript{3}=27 and so\n$27^{1/3} = 3$.\n\nWe know that the general formula for a linear approximation is given by\n\n\\[\\displaystyle\nL(x)=f(a)+f'(a)(x-a)\\]\n\nWe can find the derivative:\n\n\\[\\displaystyle\nf'(x)=\\frac{x^{-2/3}}{3}\\]\n\nKnowing these values, we can plug them in to the linear approximation\nequation and find the approximation for x=30, using a=27:\n\n\\begin{align*}\nL(x)&=(27)^{1/2}+\\frac{27^{-2/3}}{3}(x-27)\\\\\nL(30)&=(27)^{1/3}+\\frac{27^{-2/3}}{3}(30-27)\\\\\n&=3+\\frac{1/9}{3}(3)\\\\\n&=3+\\frac{1}{9}\\\\\n&=\\frac{28}{9}\n\\end{align*}\n\nSo using linear approximation, $(30)^{1/3} \\approx 28/9$"
