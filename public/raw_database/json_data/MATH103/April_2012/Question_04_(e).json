    "statement": "Consider the differential equation\n\n\\[\\frac{dy}{dt} = -\\lambda t \\left( \\frac{y^2 - k^2}{y} \\right),\\]\n\nwhere $\\lambda$ is a positive constant, \\emph{t} $\\geq$ 0, \\emph{k}\n\\textgreater{} 0, but \\emph{y} may be positive or negative. Suppose\n\\emph{y}(0) = \\emph{y}\\textsubscript{0}.\n\nSuppose \\emph{y}\\textsubscript{0} = -\\emph{k}/2. Write the solution to\nthe differential equation above in the form\n\n\\[y(t) = \\cdots.\\]\n\nWhat happens as $t \\to \\infty$?",

        "Using similar reasoning as the previous problems,\n\n\\[y(t) = \\pm k \\sqrt{1 \\pm 3/4 e^{-\\lambda  t^2}}\\]\n\nWhen \\emph{t}=0, \\emph{y}(0)\\textless{}0, so we need to take the\npositive branch outside the square root:\n\n\\[y(t) = - k \\sqrt{1 \\pm 3/4 e^{-\\lambda  t^2}},\\]\n\nIf we evaluate this at \\emph{t}=0, the positive branch gives\n$y(0) = -k \\sqrt{7/4}$, which is wrong, since\n\\emph{y}(0)=y\\textsubscript{0}=-\\emph{k}/2. Hence this is the wrong\nbranch, as before. The negative branch gives\n$y(0) = -k \\sqrt{1 - 3/4} = -k/2.$ Our answer is therefore\n\n\\[y(t) = - k \\sqrt{1 - 3/4 e^{-\\lambda  t^2}},\\]\n\nAs $t \\to \\infty$ we have $y(t) \\to -k.$"

        "Plug in $y_0 = -\\frac{k}{2}$ into the solution of\n\\href{http://wiki.ubc.ca/Science:Math_Exam_Resources/Courses/MATH103/April_2012/Question_4_\\%28b\\%29}{Problem\n4b}. Remember that $y_0 = -\\frac{k}{2}$ and use this to select the\nappropriate signs in the expression. Then take the limit as\n$t \\to \\infty$."
