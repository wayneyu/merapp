Write down vectors \\textbf{\\emph{v}}\nand \\emph{\\textbf{J}} so that the equation \\emph{L\\textbf{v}} =\n\\textbf{\\emph{J}} describes this situation. Explain what each entry of\n\\textbf{\\emph{v}} and \\textbf{\\emph{J}} represents, and how you can use\nthe entries to compute the effective resistance between vertices 1 and\n2.",

If \\emph{c} is unknown, the effective resistance can be\ncomputed using Schur$^{\\prime}$s Complement. Remember:\n\n\\[S = \\frac{1}{R_{\\mathrm{eff}}}\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & -1\\\\ -1 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}\\]"
