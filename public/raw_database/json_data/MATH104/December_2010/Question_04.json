    "statement": "It costs a small firm C(q) dollars to produce q kilograms of a certain\nchemical, where\n\n\\[\\displaystyle{}C(q)=3q^{4/3}+50q+10000\\]\n\nThe average cost of production per kilogram is defined to be\n\n\\[\\displaystyle{}\\frac{C(q)}{q}.\\]\n\nUse calculus to find how many kilograms the firm should produce in order\nto minimize the average cost of production per kilogram. Please\nsimplify. You need not justify that your calculation actually minimizes\naverage cost.",

        "Let $A(q)$ denote the average cost per kilogram of producing $q$\nkilograms of this chemical,\n\n\\[A(q) = \\frac{C(q)}{q} = 3q^{1/3}+50+\\frac{10000}{q}.\\] The domain of\ninterest is $(0,\\infty)$ because the company cannot produce negative\nkilograms of their product. In order to find the absolute minimum of the\naverage cost function, we begin by looking for its critical points. The\nderivative of $A$ is\n\n\\[A'(q) = q^{-2/3}-\\frac{10000}{q^2}  = \\frac{1}{q^2} (q^{4/3}-10000)\\]\nThis exists everywhere in our domain and is equal to zero when\n$q^{4/3}-10000 =0$, that is, when\n\n\\[q^{\\frac43}=10000 = 10^4.\\] Since $q\\geq 0$, we can take the positive\nfourth root of both sides to obtain\n\n\\[q^{\\frac13}=10.\\] Hence,\n\n\\[q=10^3 = 1000\\] which is our final answer.\n\n\\emph{Note:}\n\n\\emph{It is easy to check that this is indeed an absolute minimum by\nnoting that $A'(q)<0$ when $q<1000$ and $A'(q)>0$ when $q>1000$. Since\n$A(q)$ is decreasing when $q<1000$ and increasing when $q>1000$, $A(q)$\nmust have an absolute minimum at $q=1000.$}\n\n\\emph{Hence, the company should produce 1000 kg of chemical in order to\nminimize its average cost.}"
