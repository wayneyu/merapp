        "To read slope field graphs, one chooses a t and x value and goes to that\npoint of the graph. The slope of the line that appears there is the\nvalue of dx/dt at those particular x and t values (for example, flat\nhorizontal lines have slope 0 and so dx/dt=0 there).", 
        "Secondly, check, if the slope field is independent of $x$ or $t$.\nTherefore, restrict the slope field to vertical or horizontal lines\n(maybe using a ruler), and verify if the restrictions look equal in any\nof these two directions.\n\nThe ODE is independent of $t$ (only depending on $x$), if the vertical\nrestrictions look equal.\n\nThe ODE is independent of $x$ (only depending on $t$), if the horizontal\nrestrictions look equal.", 
        "Thirdly, check at which $x$ (for $t$-independent slope fields) the\nslopes become horizontal. At these $x$, the appropriate ODE has an\nequilibrium, is equal to zero.\n\nOr, check at which $t$ (for $x$-independent slope fields) the slopes\nbecome horizontal. At these $t$, the appropriate ODE is equal to zero."
