        "Since the matrix \\emph{A} and \\emph{B} are related by the left\nmultiplication of that invertible matrix \\emph{M}, they share many\ncharacteristic, including rank and they row space. The reason being that\nthe left multiplication by \\emph{M} can be understood as simply being a\nset of (invertible) row operations and the rank and row space are\nproperties that are preserved under (invertible) row operations.\n\nNow, as \\emph{B} is in row echelon form, it is easier to read this\ninformation from the matrix \\emph{B}, so we will use to answer the\nquestion. As \\emph{B} has 3 pivots, we see that the rank is 3. We can\nalso take each row that has a pivot to form a basis of the row space,\nthus our basis is given by:\n\n$\\left[ \\begin{array}{ccccc}\n1 & 2 & 1 & 3 & 2 \\\\ \n\\end{array} \\right] , \\left[ \\begin{array}{ccccc}\n0 & 1 & -3 & 5 & 4 \\\\ \n\\end{array} \\right] , \\left[ \\begin{array}{ccccc}\n0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & -7 \\\\ \n\\end{array} \\right]$"
