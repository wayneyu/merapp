Thus, by the\nmean value theorem, there exists a point $\\displaystyle c \\in [0,4]$\nsuch that\n\n$\\displaystyle f'(c) = \\frac{f(4)-f(0)}{4-0}$.\n\nWe know that on $\\displaystyle [0,4]$ that $\\displaystyle f'(x) \\geq 3$.\nSince $\\displaystyle c \\in [0,4]$ and $\\displaystyle f(0) = 10$ , we\nhave that\n\n$\\displaystyle 3 \\leq f'(c) = \\frac{f(4)-f(0)}{4-0} = \\frac{f(4)-10}{4}$.\n\nSolving gives $\\displaystyle 22 \\leq f(4)$ and hence the minimum\n$\\displaystyle f(4)$ could be is 22."
