For visual\neffects, the angle $\\theta$ changes periodically and randomly. The angle\n$\\theta$ is chosen uniformly in the interval\n$(-\\frac{\\pi}{4},\\frac{\\pi}{4})$, that is, the probability density\nfunction (pdf) is $p(\\theta) = \\frac{2}{\\pi}$ for\n$-\\frac{\\pi}{4} < \\theta < \\frac{\\pi}{4}$ and zero elsewhere.}\n\n\\begin{figure}[htbp]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=.5\\textwidth]{MATH103_2013Q6.jpg}\n\\caption{MATH103 2013Q6.jpg }\n\\end{figure}\n\nThe mean \\emph{x}-coordinate $\\displaystyle \\overline{x}$ of the laser\npoint is given by $\\displaystyle \\overline{x} = \\int_{a}^{b}xp(x)\\,dx$\nwhere \\emph{a} corresponds to the x value for\n$\\displaystyle \\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{4}$ and \\emph{b} corresponds to the x\nvalue for $\\displaystyle \\theta = \\frac{-\\pi}{4}$.
