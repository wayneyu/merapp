        "We can calculate the slope of the line by using two points on the line,\nsay $(0,8)$ and $(8,0)$. These two points give us a slope of $-1$.\n\nBecause the line is tangent to the graph at $(p=2,q=6)$ and its slope is\n$-1$, we know that $\\frac{dq}{dp} = -1$ at $(2,6)$.\n\nThus, by using the elasticity formula above, we get\n$\\epsilon = \\frac{p}{q} \\frac{dp}{dq} = \\frac{2}{6} (-1) = -1/3$."

        "Remember that the derivative $dq/dp$ at $p=2$ is the same as the slope\nof the tangent line at $p=2$."
