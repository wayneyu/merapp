        "We have that\n\n\\[f'(x)=\\frac{2\\ln{}x}{x}.\\]\n\nThe second derivative is (using quotient rule),\n\n\\[f''(x)=\\frac{\\frac{2}{x}x-2\\ln{}x(1)}{x^2}=2\\frac{1-\\ln{x}}{x^2}.\\]\n\nIn order to find intervals of concavity we must check where the second\nderivative is zero or does not exist. We see that the second derivative\nis zero whenever 1-lnx=0. This occurs if x=e. The second derivative\ndoesn't exist if x=0 (the denominator vanishes) or if x\\textless{}0\nsince then the logarithm cannot be evaluated. In fact we anticipate that\nx\\textless{}0 is not even in the domain of the function. Therefore our\nintervals of interest are $(0,e),(e,\\infty)$. We can make a table (or\nnumber line) as follows\n\n\\begin{longtable}[c]{@{}lll@{}}\n& $\\displaystyle{}(0,e)$ & $(e,\\infty)$\\\\\n\n$1-\\ln{x}$ & $\\displaystyle{}+$ & $\\displaystyle{}-$\\\\\n$x^2$ & $\\displaystyle{}+$ & $\\displaystyle{}+$\\\\\n$\\displaystyle{}f''(x)$ & $\\displaystyle{}+$ & $\\displaystyle{}-$\\\\\n$\\displaystyle{}f(x)$ & Concave Up & Concave Down\\\\\n\\end{longtable}\n\nTherefore we have that f(x) is concave up on $\\displaystyle{}(0,e)$ and\nconcave down on $(e,\\infty)$."
