        "We are on a finite domain, so we anticipate that separation of variables\nis a reasonable approach to this problem. With this in mind, we attempt\na solution of the form $u(x,t)=\\psi(x)\\phi(t).$ Upon applying the\nboundary conditions at $x=0$, we get,\\\\$u(0,t)=\\psi(0)\\phi(t)=0$\\\\which\nimplies for non-zero $\\phi(t)$ that we require, $\\psi(0)=0$. Similarly\nat the other endpoint, $x=\\pi$, we conclude that $\\psi(\\pi)=0$. For the\nhomogeneous initial condition on the derivative of\n$u$,\\\\$u_t(x,0)=\\psi(x)\\phi_t(0)=0$\\\\we get that for non-zero $\\psi(x)$\nthat $\\phi_t(0)=0$. Recall that we can only analyze homogeneous boundary\nconditions with the technique of separation of variables because they\nimply conditions on $\\psi(x)$ and $\\phi(t)$ to be non-trivial. We will\ndeal with the last condition $u(x,0)=f(x)$ at the end. Now, substitute\nour form for $u(x,t)$ into the PDE, $u_{tt}=u_{xx}$ to\nget\\begin{align*}\n\\psi(x)\\phi_{tt}(t)&=\\phi(t)\\psi_{xx}(x)\\\\\n\\frac{\\phi_{tt}(t)}{\\phi(t)}&=\\frac{\\psi_{xx}}{\\psi}=-\\lambda\n\\end{align*}\nwith $\\lambda$ a constant. This constant comes from the\nfact that on the left side we have a function only containing the time\nvariable $t$ and on the right side, a function only containing the space\nvariable $x$. Therefore, the only way a function of $t$ can equal a\nfunction of $x$ is if they are a constant. The choice of $\\lambda$ being\nnegative is in general, arbitrary, but chosen for a reason we will see\nshortly. We now have the following ODE's to solve:\\begin{align*}\n\\psi_{xx}(x)&=-\\lambda\\psi(x),\\qquad{}\\psi(0)=\\psi(\\pi)=0\\\\\n\\phi_{tt}(t)&=-\\lambda\\phi(t),\\qquad{}\\phi_t(0)=0.\n\\end{align*}\nWe will start by solving the equation for $\\psi(x)$\nbecause it has the two boundary conditions required for a complete\nsolution. We start by analyzing different possible values of\n$\\lambda$.\\\\\\\\\\textbf{Case 1:}$\\lambda<0$.\\\\If $\\lambda<0$\nthen\\\\$\\psi_{xx}(x)=-\\lambda\\psi(x)$\\\\has solution\n$\\psi(x)=a_1\\exp(\\sqrt{-\\lambda}x)+b_1\\exp(-\\sqrt{-\\lambda}x)$ which\nafter applying the conditions $\\psi(0)=\\psi(\\pi)=0$ results in\n$a_1=b_1=0$. Therefore $\\lambda<0$ is \\textbf{not} permitted if we want\nto have non-trivial solutions.\\\\\\\\\\textbf{Case 2:}$\\lambda=0$\\\\If\n$\\lambda=0$ then\\\\$\\psi_{xx}(x)=-\\lambda\\psi(x)$\\\\has solution\n$\\psi(x)=a_2x+b_2$ which after applying the conditions\n$\\psi(0)=\\psi(\\pi)=0$ results in $a_2=b_2=0$. Therefore $\\lambda=0$ is\n\\textbf{not} permitted if we want to have non-trivial\nsolutions.\\\\\\\\\\textbf{Case 3:}$\\lambda>0$\\\\If $\\lambda>0$\nthen\\\\$\\psi_{xx}(x)=-\\lambda\\psi(x)$\\\\has solution\n$\\psi(x)=a_3\\sin(\\sqrt{\\lambda}x)+b_3\\cos(\\sqrt{\\lambda}x)$. Applying\nthe condition at $x=0$,\\\\$\\psi(0)=a_2\\sin(0)+b_3\\cos(0)=b_3=0$\\\\and so\nwe conclude that $b_3=0$. At the other endpoint,\n$x=\\pi$,\\\\$\\psi(\\pi)=a_2\\sin(\\sqrt{\\lambda}\\pi)=0.$\\\\In order for this\ncondition to be satisfied we require that $\\sqrt{\\lambda}\\pi=n\\pi$ or\nthat $\\lambda=n^2$ with $n=1,2,3\\dots$, an integer. We must start at\n$n=1$ because we already concluded that $\\lambda=0$ is invalid.\nTherefore, we conclude (ignoring the constant out front)\nthat,\\\\$\\psi(x)=\\sin(nx).$\\\\Before, we continue, note that had I taken\n$\\lambda$ instead of $-\\lambda$ for the original constant, I would have\ndone the same analysis and recovered the same function, only with\n$\\lambda<0$ being the requirement. We choose the constant to be\n$-\\lambda$ from the start so that we have positive values of $\\lambda$\nbut this is really just a matter of style. Now for the other\ndifferential equation, knowing $\\lambda=n^2$ we\nhave\\\\$\\phi_{tt}=-n\\phi(t)$\\\\which, recalling $n>0$, has solution,\n$\\phi(t)=a_4\\cos(nt)+b_4\\sin(nt)$. Applying the condition that\n$\\phi_t(0)=0$ we conclude that $b_4=0$ so\nthat,\\\\$\\phi(t)=\\cos(nt)$\\\\where we once again haven't included the\nconstant out front of the solution. Finally, combining all this\ninformation we get that $u(x,t)=A_n\\sin(nx)\\cos(nt)$ but this must hold\nfor all $n$ and therefore, by the principle of\nsuperposition,\\\\$u(x,t)=\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty{}A_n\\sin(nx)\\cos(nt).$\\\\Now we\nknow that $u(x,0)=\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty{}A_n\\sin(nx)=f(x)$ and so we could\napply the usual Fourier series orthogonality to get\nthat,\\\\$A_n=\\frac{2}{\\pi}\\int_0^\\pi{}f(x)\\sin(nx)\\textrm{d}x$\\\\which\nwill work just fine. However, in this case, $f(x)=2\\sin(2x)$ is special\nbecause it is one of the eigenfunctions (i.e. it is of the form,\n$\\sin(nx)$ with $n=2$). Therefore, $\\sin(2x)$ is orthogonal to every\neigenfunction of the form $\\sin(nx)$ except for when $n=2$. Therefore,\nonly the coefficient $A_2$ will be non-zero and is given\nby,\\\\$A_2=\\frac{2}{\\pi}\\int_0^\\pi{}2\\sin(2x)^2\\textrm{d}x=2.$\\\\If you\nare unconvinced of how this works, try getting the other coefficients\nusing the formula above and you will quickly see that they are zero!\nTherefore, we conclude that the solution $u(x,t)$ to the PDE,\n$u_{tt}=u_{xx}$ is\\\\$\\displaystyle {}u(x,t)=2\\sin(2x)\\cos(2t)$"
