Therefore\n\n:&lt;math>\n\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc|c}\n1  &amp;  1  &amp;  1  &amp;  36\\\\\n  &amp;  &amp;  &amp;\\\\\n0  &amp;  \\frac{1}{2}  &amp;  \\frac{1}{2}  &amp;  10\\\\\n  &amp;  &amp;  &amp;\\\\\n0  &amp;  0  &amp;  -1/2  &amp;  -2\n\\end{array}\\right]\n\\stackrel{\\rightarrow}{2R2}\n\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc|c}\n1  &amp;  1  &amp;  1  &amp;  36\\\\\n  &amp;  &amp;  &amp;\\\\\n0  &amp;  1  &amp;  1  &amp;  20\\\\\n  &amp;  &amp;  &amp;\\\\\n0  &amp;  0  &amp;  -1/2  &amp;  -2\n\\end{array}\\right]\n&lt;/math>\n\nTo make the entries above and below this new pivot zero we must subtract row 2 from row 1 and we leave row three alone since it is already zero.\n\n:&lt;math>\n\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc|c}\n1  &amp;  1  &amp;  1  &amp;  36\\\\\n  &amp;  &amp;  &amp;\\\\\n0  &amp;  1  &amp;  1  &amp;  20\\\\\n  &amp;  &amp;  &amp;\\\\\n0  &amp;  0  &amp;  -1/2  &amp;  -2\n\\end{array}\\right]\n\\stackrel{\\rightarrow}{R1-R2}\n\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc|c}\n1  &amp;  0  &amp;  0  &amp;  16\\\\\n  &amp;  &amp;  &amp;\\\\\n0  &amp;  1  &amp;  1  &amp;  20\\\\\n  &amp;  &amp;  &amp;\\\\\n0  &amp;  0  &amp;  -1/2  &amp;  -2\n\\end{array}\\right]\n&lt;/math>\n\nFinally for the last pivot in the third row and third column we have to multiply row three by -2.  We will then have to subtract row three from row two so that the third column entry in the second row vanishes.  We do not need to perform any operations on the first row since there is already a zero in the third column.\n\n:&lt;math>\n\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc|c}\n1  &amp;  0  &amp;  0  &amp;  16\\\\\n  &amp;  &amp;  &amp;\\\\\n0  &amp;  1  &amp;  1  &amp;  20\\\\\n  &amp;  &amp;  &amp;\\\\\n0  &amp;  0  &amp;  -1/2  &amp;  -2\n\\end{array}\\right]\n\\stackrel{\\rightarrow}{-2R3}\n\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc|c}\n1  &amp;  0  &amp;  0  &amp;  16\\\\\n  &amp;  &amp;  &amp;\\\\\n0  &amp;  1  &amp;  1  &amp;  20\\\\\n  &amp;  &amp;  &amp;\\\\\n0  &amp;  0  &amp;  1  &amp;  4\n\\end{array}\\right]\n\\stackrel{\\rightarrow}{R2-R3}\n\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc|c}\n1  &amp;  0  &amp;  0  &amp;  16\\\\\n  &amp;  &amp;  &amp;\\\\\n0  &amp;  1  &amp;  0  &amp;  16\\\\\n  &amp;  &amp;  &amp;\\\\\n0  &amp;  0  &amp;  1  &amp;  4\n\\end{array}\\right]\n&lt;/math>\n\nHaving all entries zero except for the pivots we have our matrix in reduced row-echelon form.  The advantage to putting the matrix in this form is that we can immediately determine the vector '''x'''.  We have that,\n\n:&lt;math>\n\\begin{align}\nx_1&amp;=16\\\\\nx_2&amp;=16\\\\\nx_3&amp;=4\n\\end{align}\n&lt;/math>\n\nTherefore we conclude that the yield of the wheat is 16 tons/hectare for type 1, 16 tons/hectare for type 2 and 4 tons/hectare for type 3.  Notice that if we were so inclined we could put our solution in for '''x''' in the original problem an we do indeed recover the right output vector '''b'''.  If instead you opted to just put the matrix in row-echelon form, you would get\n\n:&lt;math>\n\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc|c}\n1  &amp;  1  &amp;  1  &amp;  36\\\\\n  &amp;  &amp;  &amp;\\\\\n0  &amp;  1  &amp;  1  &amp;  20\\\\\n  &amp;  &amp;  &amp;\\\\\n0  &amp;  0  &amp;  1  &amp;  4\n\\end{array}\\right]\n&lt;/math>\n\nwhich of course leads to the same conclusion but some arithmetic is involved.  This type of situation is often the trade off in deciding which process to choose.  Doing a row-echelon form is often quicker but because it only guarantees entries '''below''' pivots are zero, then arithmetic will almost always be required to get the solution.  Conversely, the reduced row-echelon form takes longer to obtain but then the unknowns are clearly presented.\n"
