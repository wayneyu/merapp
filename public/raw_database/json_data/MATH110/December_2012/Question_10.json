    "statement": "Tsunamis are large ocean waves produced by underwater seismic activity.\nIn deep water, they can travel at extremely high speeds.\n\nA tsunami wave spreads outward in a widening circle. Suppose the radius\nof the circle is increasing at a rate of $900$ km/h. Calculate how fast\nthe area of the circle is increasing when the radius is equal to $100$\nkm.",

        "The question is asking about change in area, so we will start with the\nformula for area of a circle\\[A = \\pi r^2\\]. Because the question\ninvolves rates, we will be implicitly differentiating with respect to\ntime. This gives:\n\n$\\frac{dA}{dt} = \\pi(2r)\\frac{dr}{dt}$\n\nWhere \\emph{dA/dt} is the rate at which the area of the circle is\nchanging, and \\emph{dr/dt} the rate at which the radius is changing.\nPlugging in the information from the statement of the question, we have:\n\n$\\frac{dA}{dt} = \\pi(2*100)(900) = 180,000\\pi$\n\nThus, the rate at which the area of the circle is increasing is\n$180,000\\pi$ km/h."
