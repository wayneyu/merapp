How much work, in joules (J), is done in\nstretching the spring from its natural length to 50 cm beyond its\nnatural length?",

        "Recall for springs,\n\n\\begin{align*}\\displaystyle \nf(x) = kx\\end{align*}\n\nWe are given that force is 10 N when $x$ is 5 cm = 0.05 m, so\n\n\\begin{align*}\\displaystyle \n10 = k(0.05)\\end{align*}\n\ngiving $\\displaystyle k = 200$. Then, the work done in stretching the\nspring from its natural length to 50 cm = 0.5 m beyond its natural\nlength is given by\n\n\\begin{align*}\nW &= \\int_0^{0.5} 200x \\ dx \\\\\n&= 200 \\frac{x^2}2 \\big|_0^{0.5} \\\\\n&= 25\\end{align*}\n\nSo the work done in stretching the spring is 25J."

        "Remember that force is $kx$ for a spring. But what is $k$ here?", 
        "Work is force multiplied by distance, for constant force. In this case,\nforce is not constant - what would the formula for work be?"
