        "The tangent line must have the same slope as the function $f(x)$ at\n$x = 1/2$. Solving for the slope $m$, we get\n\n\\[m = f'(1/2) = -\\pi\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right) = -\\pi.\\] The tangent\nline must also touch the function at $x = 1/2$. We use this to solve for\nthe y-intercept:\n\n\\begin{align*}\ny &= mx + b \\\\\n\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right) &= -\\pi\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) + b \\\\\n0 &= -\\frac{\\pi}{2} + b \\\\\nb &= \\frac{\\pi}{2}\n\\end{align*} Therefore, the tangent line to $f(x) = \\cos(\\pi x)$ at\n$x = 1/2$ is:\n\n\\[{\\color{blue}y = -\\pi x + \\frac{\\pi}{2}}\\]"
