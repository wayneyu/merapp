Then we want to know how far down the curve goes, so we look for its local minimum. We compute its derivative:\n:&lt;math>\n\\frac{d}{dx}\\left(x+\\frac{4}{x}\\right) = 1 - \\frac{4}{x^2}\n&lt;/math>\nand hence see that it has two critical points, one at ''x''=-2 and one at ''x''=2. We are only interested in the local minimum which is at ''x''=2. This should be enough details to have you be able to obtain the equivalent of the following picture:\n\n[[File:Math Exam Resources Courses MATH101 April 2008 Question 2 (c) picture 1.gif]]\n\nNow we want to rotate this region around the vertical axis ''x''=-1. To do this, we will use the method know as [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disk_integration disk integration]. The idea is fairly simple: imagine the solid viewed from the top (looking down at the axis), if we slice it along that axis, we will see a slice of a hollow cylinder. We will compute the area of that slice (the difference of area between the outer disk and the inner disk) and integrate.\n\nThe outer disc has a radius that starts at the point (2,4) and moves right towards the point (4,5) following the curve ''y''=''x''+4/''x''. The inner disc has a radius that starts at the point (2,4) and moves left towards the point (1,5) following the other side of the curve. We need to compute that radius (starting at x=-1). For this, the first step is to express the curve in terms of ''y'' instead of ''x'':\n:&lt;math>\n\\begin{align}\ny=x+\\frac{4}{x} &amp;\\iff yx=x^2+4\\\\\n&amp; \\iff x^2-yx+4=0\\\\\n&amp; \\iff x=\\frac{y \\pm \\sqrt{y^2-16}}{2}\n\\end{align}\n&lt;/math>\nIf we look at this, it makes sense: This is only well defined if ''y'' is larger than 4 (see on the graph) and there are two components: the one with the + for the right side and the one with the - for the left side. Since the axis of rotation is at ''x''=-1, we need to add 1 to each of the radius and obtain:\n:&lt;math>\n\\begin{align}\nr_{outer}(y) &amp;= 1+\\frac{y + \\sqrt{y^2-16}}{2}\\\\\nr_{inner}(y) &amp;= 1+\\frac{y - \\sqrt{y^2-16}}{2}\n\\end{align}\n&lt;/math>\nAnd so we can write the volume by integrating over all the shells, which are obtained by taking the difference of the outer and inner disk:\n:&lt;math>\nV = \\int_4^5 \\left( \\pi \\left( 1+\\frac{y}{2} + \\frac{\\sqrt{y^2-16}}{2}\\right)^2 - \\pi \\left( 1+\\frac{y}{2} - \\frac{\\sqrt{y^2-16}}{2}\\right)^2 \\right) \\,dy\n&lt;/math>\n(since the area of a disk of radius ''r'' is &lt;math>\\pi&lt;/math> r&lt;sup>2&lt;/sup>).\n\nNow we can do some algebra to rewrite this integral into something easier to handle. Notice the pattern here\n:&lt;math>\\displaystyle\n(A+B)^2 - (A-B)^2 = 4AB\n&lt;/math>\nHence we can rewrite this as\n:&lt;math>\n\\begin{align}\nV &amp;= \\pi \\int_4^5 4(1+\\frac{y}{2})(\\frac{\\sqrt{y^2-16}}{2}) \\,dy\\\\\n&amp;= \\pi \\int_4^5 (2+y)(\\sqrt{y^2-16}) \\,dy\\\\\n\\end{align}\n&lt;/math>\n\nNow we need to compute that integral to obtain the desired volume. Unfortunately, this won't be straightforward since (2+''y'') isn't a multiple of the derivative of what is in the square root. There are many ways to compute this integral, here we will split it in 2 and deal with each term.\n:&lt;math>\nV = \\pi \\int_4^5 2\\sqrt{y^2-16} \\,dy + \\pi \\int_4^5 y\\sqrt{y^2-16} \\,dy\n&lt;/math>\nLet us call the first integral V&lt;sub>1&lt;/sub> and the second one V&lt;sub>2&lt;/sub>. The first one is the tougher one. Indeed:\n:&lt;math>\n\\begin{align}\nV_2 &amp;= \\pi \\int_4^5 y\\sqrt{y^2-16} \\,dy \\\\\n&amp;= \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\int_4^5 2y\\sqrt{y^2-16} \\,dy \\\\\n&amp;= \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\left[ \\frac{2}{3}(y^2-16)^{3/2} \\right]_4^5 \\\\\n&amp;= \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\frac{2}{3} (25-16)^{3/2} \\\\\n&amp;= \\frac{\\pi}{3} \\cdot 27 \\\\\n&amp;= 9\\pi\n\\end{align}\n&lt;/math>\n\nThe first integral is actually quite complicated. At the same time it is a classic. As of today (2012) you are not expected to be able to integrate this by hand and/or know the formula from memory. For completion sake, here is the formula:\n:&lt;math>\n\\int \\sqrt{x^2-a^2} \\,dx = \\frac{x}{2} \\sqrt{x^2-a^2} - \\frac{a^2}{2} \\ln( x+ \\sqrt{x^2-a^2}) + c\n&lt;/math>\nWhich in this case gives us:\n:&lt;math>\\begin{align}\nV_1 &amp;= \\pi \\int_4^5 2\\sqrt{y^2-16} \\,dy \\\\\n&amp;= 2\\pi \\left[ \\frac{y}{2} \\sqrt{y^2-16} - 8 \\ln( y+ \\sqrt{y^2-16}) \\right]_4^5 \\\\\n&amp;= 2\\pi \\left[ (\\frac{5}{2} \\sqrt{9} - 8 \\ln( 5 + \\sqrt{9} ) - (0 - 8 \\ln( 4 + 0)) \\right] \\\\\n&amp;= 2\\pi (\\frac{15}{2} - 8 \\ln(8) + 8\\ln(4) \\\\\n&amp;= \\pi (15 - 48 \\ln(2) + 32 \\ln(2) ) \\\\\n&amp;= \\pi (15 - 16\\ln(2))\n\\end{align}\n&lt;/math>\n\nSumming &lt;math>\\displaystyle V = V_{1} + V_{2} &lt;/math> gives &lt;math> \\displaystyle V = 24\\pi - 16\\pi\\ln(2)&lt;/math> which is the same as above.\n\n... This is why using the correct method of solids of revolution is very important.\n"
