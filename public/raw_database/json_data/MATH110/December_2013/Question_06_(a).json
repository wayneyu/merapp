        "We first simplify using the exponential rules to get\n$f(x) = e^{x^3 + 2x^2 + x - 3}.$ Then we can solve for $f(x) = 0$.\n\n\\begin{align*}\ne^{x^3 + 2x^2 + x - 3} &= 0\\\\\nx^3 + 2x^2 + x - 3 &= \\ln(0).\\end{align*}\n\nBy taking the natural logarithm of both sides, we get a $\\ln(0)$ on the\nright hand side which is bad since $0$ is not in the domain of the\nnatural logarithm. So we conclude that there cannot be a solution to the\nequation $f(x)=0$. Hence, we have $0$ solutions."
