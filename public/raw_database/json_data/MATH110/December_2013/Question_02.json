    "statement": "Find the equations of the two tangent lines to the curve\n\n\\begin{align*}f(x) = \\frac{x - 4}{x + 4}\\end{align*} that are parallel to the line x - 2y = 2.", 
    "year": 2013, 
    "sols": [
        "We first recognise that parallel means that the slopes must be equal.\nRearranging the equation, we get:\n\n\\begin{align*}\nx-2y &= 2\\\\\nx-2 &= 2y\\\\\ny&= \\frac{x-2}{2}\\\\\ny &= \\frac{1}{2} x - 1.\\end{align*}\n\nSo that means we are looking for points along the curve with slope equal\nto $\\frac{1}{2}$. To get those points, we need the derivative of the\ncurve:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n{\\frac{{\\rm d}}{{\\rm d}x}} (y) &= {\\frac{{\\rm d}}{{\\rm d}x}} \\left(\\frac{x-4}{x+4}\\right)\\end{align*}\n\nUsing the quotient rule, we get:\n\n\\begin{align*}\nu(x) &= x-4 & u'(x) = 1\\\\\nv(x) &= x+4 & v'(x) = 1\\end{align*}\n\nSo that means:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n{\\frac{{\\rm d} {y}}{{\\rm d}x}} &= \\frac{v(x)u'(x) - u(x)v'(x)}{\\left(v(x)\\right)^2}\\\\\n&= \\frac{(x+4)\\cdot (1) - (x-4) \\cdot(1)}{\\left(x+4\\right)^2}\\\\\n&= \\frac{8}{\\left(x+4\\right)^2}\\end{align*}\n\nWe are interested in points where the derivative is $\\frac{1}{2}$\n\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{1}{2} &= \\frac{8}{\\left(x+4\\right)^2}\\\\\n\\left(x+4\\right)^2 &= 16\\\\\nx+4 &= \\pm 4\\\\\nx &= 0 , -8\\end{align*}\n\nThis means we have to tackle two potential $x$ values. At $x=0$, we\nhave:\n\n\\begin{align*}\ny &= \\frac{0-4}{0+4} = -1\\end{align*}\n\nAt $x=-8$, we have:\n\n\\begin{align*}\ny &= \\frac{-8-4}{-8+4} = \\frac{-12}{-4} = 3\\end{align*}\n\nSo that means the tangent lines are are looking for are: for $x=0$.\n\n\\begin{align*}\ny &= \\frac{1}{2}(x-0) +(-1)\\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{2}x - 1\\\\end{align*}\n\nand for $x=-8$\n\n\\begin{align*}\ny &= \\frac{1}{2}(x-(-8)) + 3\\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{2} (x+8) +  3\\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{2} x +  7\\\\end{align*}"

        "Remember that the derivative of a function at a point is equal to the\nslope of the tangent line at that point. First find the slope of the\ngiven line by changing this equation to the form\n$\\displaystyle y = mx + b$", 
        "Once you find the slope of the given line, set it equal to the\nderivative of the given function, which we find using the quotient rule.", 
        "Following the first two hints, we should now have two \\emph{x}-values.\nPlug these values back into the function definition to find the\n\\emph{y}-values. After this, you now have the points and the slope of\nthe two lines you need to find to solve the question."
