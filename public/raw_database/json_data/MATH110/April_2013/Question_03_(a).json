    "sols": [
        "The function has \\emph{x}-intercepts whenever\n\n$0 = \\frac{\\sin(x)}{e^{x}}$\n\nThis occurs whenever $\\sin(x) = 0$ on the interval $[0, \\pi]$. This\noccurs when the \\emph{x} value is 0 or $\\pi$."

    "hints": [
        "Recall that the \\emph{x}-intercepts are found by setting the function to\nzero and solving."
