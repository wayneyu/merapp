        "Proceeding as in the hints, recall that $R = pq$ and thus\n\n\\begin{align*}\\frac{dR}{dt} = q\\frac{dp}{dt} + p\\frac{dq}{dt}\\end{align*}\n\nPlugging in $\\frac{dR}{dt} = 0.15$ and $p=4$ and $q=2$ gives\n\n\\begin{align*}0.15 = 2\\frac{dp}{dt} + 4\\frac{dq}{dt}\\end{align*}\n\nNotice that we have two unknowns and one equation so we'll need to find\nanother equation to get our target value of $\\frac{dp}{dt}$. This means\nwe need to eliminate $\\frac{dq}{dt}$. To do this we can differentiate\nthe original demand equation given in the problem with respect to t,\n\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{d}{dt}\\left(q^2+p^{3/2}+2p\\right)&=\\frac{d}{dt}20\\\\\n2q\\frac{dq}{dt} + \\frac{3\\sqrt{p}}{2} \\frac{dp}{dt} + 2\\frac{dp}{dt}&= 0.\\end{align*}\n\nPlugging in the information above gives\n\n\\begin{align*}2(2)\\frac{dq}{dt} + \\frac{3\\sqrt{4}}{2} \\frac{dp}{dt} + 2\\frac{dp}{dt} = 0\\end{align*}\n\nand simplifying\n\n\\begin{align*}4\\frac{dq}{dt} + 5\\frac{dp}{dt} = 0\\end{align*}\n\nThis gives us our second equation. Subtracting the second equation from\nthe first gives\n\n\\begin{align*}3\\frac{dp}{dt} = -0.15\\end{align*}\n\nand thus\n\n\\begin{align*}\\frac{dp}{dt} = -0.05\\end{align*}\n\nSo the rate in price must be changed by a decrease of 5 cents (0.05\ndollars) per hour completing the question."

        "Here we are given that\n\n$\\frac{dR}{dt} = 0.15$\n\nas well as $p=4$ and from computations in the\n\\href{Science:Math_Exam_Resources/Courses/MATH104/December_2012/Question_4_(a)}{first\npart}, we know that $q=2$. We seek to find $\\frac{dp}{dt}$. What's the\nrelationship between revenue, price and quantity?", 
        "Recall that $R = pq$. Use implicit differentiation with respect to the\nvariable \\emph{t} to get the quantities we need. Notice however that we\nhave two unknowns in our equation. Where can we find another equation?", 
        "Look back to the original given equation and differentiate implicitly\nwith respect to the variable \\emph{t}. Then solve the subsequent system\nof equations."
