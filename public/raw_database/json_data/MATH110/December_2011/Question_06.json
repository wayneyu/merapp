        "In order for $f(x)$ to be differentiable at \\emph{a}, we have two\nrequirements: that the function be continous and derivatives from the\nright and left of a point are the same.\n\nBefore we start, let us note that \\emph{$f$} is surely, as a composition\nof differentiable functions, differentiable at all points expect \\emph{x\n= a}. Hence we can focus our study on the point \\emph{x = a}.\n\nWe begin with the second condition: that the derivative from the right\n($x < a$) must be the same as the derivative from the left ($x > a$).\nThis means that we are trying to find the value \\emph{a} such that\n\n\\begin{align*}\\displaystyle\n -\\frac{1}{2}\\sin a = 2a\\end{align*}\n\nSimplifying a bit, this is the same as\n\n\\begin{align*}\\displaystyle\n -\\sin a = 4a\\end{align*}\n\nIf we think about the function $-\\sin x$ we know that it is bounded\nbetween -1 and 1. If a was greater than 1/4, say, 1/2, the left side\nwould be less than one, while the right side would already be greater\nthan 2. So \\emph{a} must be between -1/4 and 1/4 for this equation to\nhold. In fact, the only place that the graphs of $- \\sin x$ and\n\\emph{4x} intersect is at \\emph{x = 0.} So \\emph{a = 0.}\n\nThis satisfies the condition that the derivatives match; now we must\nensure that $f(x)$ is continuous. The function is defined everywhere, so\nwe must check that the limit at \\emph{x = a} exists.\n\nThe limit from the left of \\emph{x = 0} is\n\n\\begin{align*}\\displaystyle\n\\lim_{x \\to 0^-} f(x) = \\lim_{x \\to 0^-}\\frac{1}{2}\\cos x = \\frac{1}{2}\\end{align*}\n\nThe limit from the right of \\emph{x = 0} is\n\n\\begin{align*}\\displaystyle\n\\lim_{x \\to 0^+} f(x) = \\lim_{x \\to 0^+}x^2 + b = b\\end{align*}\n\nThese two limits must be equal, so we have \\emph{b} = 1/2."
