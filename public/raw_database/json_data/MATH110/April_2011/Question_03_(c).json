        "In the previous question, we showed that for some $c$ in the interval\n$(0,b)$\n\n\\[\\cos(c) = \\frac{\\sin(b)}{b}\\]\n\nNow we know that for all possible values of $c$, $\\cos(c)$ is bounded\nabove by 1, or\n\n\\[\\cos(c) \\leq 1\\]\n\nSubstituting what we know from part (b), this is the same as\n\n\\[\\frac{\\sin(b)}{b} \\leq 1\\]\n\nBecause $b > 0$ we can multiply both sides by \\emph{b} to get\n\n\\[\\sin(b) \\leq b\\]\n\nWhich completes our proof."
