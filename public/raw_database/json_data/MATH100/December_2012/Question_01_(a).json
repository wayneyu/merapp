        "Since $\\tfrac{d}{dx}\\sin(x) = \\cos(x)$ and $\\tfrac{d}{dx}e^{x} = e^{x}$,\nwe have that the function given by $f(x) = 2\\sin(x) - e^{x} +C$ where\n\\emph{C} is any constant are functions that have the given derivative.\n\nSince we are also given that $f(0) = 0$, we plug this information in to\nsee that $0 = f(0) = 2\\sin(0) - e^{0} + C = 0-1 + C$. Isolating for\n\\emph{C} gives $C=1$. Thus the required function is given by\n\n\\[\\displaystyle f(x) = 2\\sin(x) - e^{x} + 1\\]"
