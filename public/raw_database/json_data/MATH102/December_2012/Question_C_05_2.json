    "statement": "Choose ONE of the next two problems (C.5.1 or C.5.2).\n\nAn architect is designing a house in the form of a cylinder covered by a\nroof in the shape of half a sphere (extending above the cylinder).\nSuppose the material used to build the cylindrical wall is half the\nprice of the material that is used to build the roof per unit area. If\nthe total volume of the house is fixed, what ratio between the height of\nthe wall and the radius of the roof will minimize the cost?",

        "Let's start with a picture.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htbp]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=.5\\textwidth]{MER_Math_102_December_2012_Question_C_5_2_Solution.jpg}\n\\caption{MER Math 102 December 2012 Question C 5 2 Solution.jpg}\n\\end{figure}\n\nLet \\emph{P} be the price of the wall material per square area. Thus,\nthe price of the roof is \\emph{2P} per square area. Let \\emph{V} be the\ngiven volume. The formula for the volume of this house is\n\n$V = \\pi r^{2} h + \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{4}{3} \\pi r^{3}\\right) = \\pi r^{2} \\left(h + \\frac{2r}{3} \\right)$\n\nwhere the first term is the volume of a cylinder and the second term is\nhalf the volume of a sphere. We will need to isolate for \\emph{h} later\nso doing so now while the formula is fresh, we have\n\n$h = \\frac{V}{\\pi r^{2}} - \\frac{2r}{3}$\n\nWe're minimizing the cost of the house. The cost of this house is equal\nto the surface area of the wall multiplied by the price added to the\nsurface area of the roof multiplied by \\emph{2P}. As part of our\nsimplification process, we'll plug in the formula for \\emph{h}\nimmediately above, to arrive at a final equation that's only in terms of\none variable, \\emph{r}.\n\n\\begin{align*}\nC &= 2\\pi rhP + 0.5(4\\pi r^{2})(2P) \\\\\n&= 2\\pi rP(h + 2r)\\\\\n&= 2\\pi rP\\left(\\frac{V}{\\pi r^{2}} - \\frac{2r}{3} + 2r \\right)\\\\\n&= 2\\pi rP\\left(\\frac{V}{\\pi r^{2}} + \\frac{4r}{3} \\right)\\end{align*}\n\nFollowing our usual procedure for optimization, we take the derivative\nby the product rule. Recall that \\emph{V} and \\emph{P} are constants -\nour only variable is \\emph{r}.\n\n\\begin{align*}\nC' &= 2\\pi P\\left( \\left(\\frac{V}{\\pi r^{2}} + \\frac{4r}{3}\\right) + r\\left(\\frac{-2V}{\\pi r^{3}} + \\frac{4}{3}\\right) \\right)\\\\\n&= 2\\pi P\\left( \\left(\\frac{V}{\\pi r^{2}} + \\frac{4r}{3}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{-2V}{\\pi r^{2}} + \\frac{4r}{3}\\right) \\right)\\end{align*}\n\nThis is where we'll replace \\emph{V} with our original volume formula\nabove, and simplify.\n\n\\begin{align*}\nC' &= 2\\pi P\\left( \\left(h + \\frac{2r}{3} + \\frac{4r}{3}\\right) + \\left(-2\\left(h + \\frac{2r}{3}\\right) + \\frac{4r}{3}\\right) \\right)\\\\\n&= 2\\pi P\\left( \\left(h + 2r\\right) + \\left(-2h\\right) \\right)\\\\\n&= 2\\pi P(2r-h)\\end{align*}\n\nSetting the derivative to zero and solving gives\n$\\frac{r}{h} = \\frac{1}{2}$. One more subtlety with this problem is that\nwe should verify that this is indeed a minimum. Plugging back in terms\nof \\emph{r} in the first derivative gives\n\n\\begin{align*}\nC' &= 2\\pi P(2r-h)\\\\\n&= 2\\pi P(2r-(V/(\\pi r^{2}) - 2r/3))\\\\\n&= 2\\pi P(8r/3 - V/(\\pi r^{2}))\\\\\n&= 2\\pi P((8\\pi r^{3} - 3V)/(3\\pi r^{2}))\\end{align*}\n\nSetting to zero and solving gives $r^{3} = 3V/(8\\pi) > 0$ (notice that\n\\emph{r} equal 0 is not admissible since our house needs a radius, so we\ndon't need to worry about this critical point). Taking the second\nderivative yields\n\n\\begin{align*}\nC'' &= 8/3 + \\frac{2V}{\\pi r^{3}}\\end{align*}\n\nand since \\emph{r} is positive in our critical value, we see that our\nsecond derivative is positive, hence our cost function is concave up and\nthus this ratio of \\emph{r} to \\emph{h} is a minimum as required."

        "Draw a picture. Find a formula expressing the volume of the house in\nterms of \\emph{r} and \\emph{h}. Then find a formula for the cost of the\nhouse in terms of \\emph{r}, \\emph{h}, and \\emph{P}. Which formula are\nyou optimizing? What is the next step when solving optimization\nproblems?", 
        "In this problem, you are optimizing the cost function. Before taking the\nderivative, you will need to reduce this equation from two variables\n(\\emph{r} and \\emph{h}) to one (\\emph{r}). To do so, solve the volume\nequation for \\emph{h} and substitute it into your cost function.", 
        "After taking the derivative, set it equal to zero. Normally you would\nnow solve for critical points - however, this question is asking for a\nratio, not a single value. In order to find this ratio, you'll have to\nre-introduce the variable \\emph{h} into the derivative by substituting\nthe volume formula in for \\emph{V}."
