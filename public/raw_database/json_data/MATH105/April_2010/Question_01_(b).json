        "We are asked here to compute the second derivative of the given function\nwith respect to \\emph{y}. So we start by taking the first derivative\nwith respect to \\emph{y} and obtain\n\n\\[\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} (x,y) = 2x e^{2y} + 2y\\] (Remember that\nwhile doing this, we treat the variable \\emph{x} as if it was a\nconstant). And now we go on for the second derivative with respect to\n\\emph{y} and obtain\n\n\\[\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y^2} (x,y) = \\frac{\\partial }{\\partial y}\\left( \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} (x,y) \\right) = 4x e^{2y} + 2\\]"

        "What does the symbols\n\n\\[\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y^2}\\] mean in plain English?", 
        "Recall that when computing a partial derivative with respect to the\nvariable \\emph{y}, you have to treat the variable \\emph{x} as if it was\na constant, so for example the partial derivative of \\emph{xy} with\nrespect to the variable \\emph{y} is simply \\emph{x} the same way that\nthe derivative of \\emph{3y} with respect to \\emph{y} would be 3."
