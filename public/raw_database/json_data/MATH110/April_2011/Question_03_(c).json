        "In the previous question, we showed that for some $c$ in the interval\n$(0,b)$\n\n\\begin{align*}\\cos(c) = \\frac{\\sin(b)}{b}\\end{align*}\n\nNow we know that for all possible values of $c$, $\\cos(c)$ is bounded\nabove by 1, or\n\n\\begin{align*}\\cos(c) \\leq 1\\end{align*}\n\nSubstituting what we know from part (b), this is the same as\n\n\\begin{align*}\\frac{\\sin(b)}{b} \\leq 1\\end{align*}\n\nBecause $b > 0$ we can multiply both sides by \\emph{b} to get\n\n\\begin{align*}\\sin(b) \\leq b\\end{align*}\n\nWhich completes our proof."
