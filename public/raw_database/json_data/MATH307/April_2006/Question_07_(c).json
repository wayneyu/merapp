    "statement": "Let \\emph{P} be the projection of all vectors in $\\mathbb{R}^{4}$ into\nR(A) which is the column space of the matrix\n\n$\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 0 \\\\\n-1 & 1 \\\\\n1 & 1 \\\\\n0 & -2 \n\\end{bmatrix}$.\n\nLet R be the reflection in R(A). Answer the following questions with\nlittle or no calculation. You do not need to find the projection and the\nreflection matrices to answer these questions.\n\nFor the projection \\emph{P}, determine the relation between its row\nspace and its column space and the relation between its nullspace and\nleft nullspace. Then find a basis for each one of the four fundamental\nsubspaces.",
