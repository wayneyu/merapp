        "The depth of the water is $2 \\text{ } ft$, so we divide the tank wall\ninto $n$ horizontal strips of height $\\Delta x = (2 - 0)/n.$ The width\nof every strip is $2 \\text{ } ft$, so the area of each strip is\n$A_i = 2 \\Delta x.$ The hydrostatic force on a strip at depth\n$x_{i}^{\\ast}$ is\n\n\\[F_i = \\rho g x_{i}^{\\ast} A_i = \\rho g x_{i}^{\\ast}(2 \\Delta x).\\]\n\nWe are given that the weight density of the fluid is\n$\\rho g = 50 \\text{ } lb/ft^3.$ To get the total force on the wall, we\nadd up all the forces $F_i$ and take the limit as\n$n \\rightarrow \\infty:$\n\n\\[F = \\lim_{n \\rightarrow \\infty} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} F_i \n= 2 \\rho g \\lim_{n \\rightarrow \\infty} \\sum_{i=1}^{n}  x_{i}^{\\ast} \\Delta x\n= 2 \\rho g \\int_{0}^{2} x dx\n= 2 \\cdot 50 \\cdot 2\n= 200 \\text{ } lb.\\]\n\nWe integrate from $0$ to $2$ because the water extends from depth\n$0 \\text{ } ft$ to $2 \\text{ } ft$. This is also why we set\n$\\Delta x = (2 - 0)/n.$"

        "Divide the tank wall into many small horizontal strips and consider the\nhydrostatic force\n($\\text{Force} = \\text{density} \\times \\text{pressure} \\times \\text{depth} \\times \\text{area}$)\non each. The total force will be approximately the sum of the forces on\nall the strips. Let the number of strips go to infinity to make the\napproximation exact."
