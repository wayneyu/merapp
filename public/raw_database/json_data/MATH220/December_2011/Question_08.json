        "By saying that we look at primes larger than 4, what we really mean is\nwe look at all the primes except 2 and 3 (which makes sense since\n2\\textsuperscript{2} = 4 and 3\\textsuperscript{2} = 9 which is 3 mod 6;\nso these two don't work anyway).\n\nNow any prime \\emph{p} other than 2 and 3 will then clearly NOT be a\nmultiple of two and NOT be a multiple of 3. This means that\n\n\\begin{align*}\\displaystyle\np \\equiv 1 \\text{ or } 5 \\pmod 6\\end{align*} since integers that are 0, 2 or 4 mod\n6 are all even and since an integer that is 3 mod 6 is a multiple of 3.\n\nBut since\n\n\\begin{align*}\\displaystyle\n1^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 6\\end{align*} and\n\n\\begin{align*}\\displaystyle\n5^2 =25 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 6\\end{align*}\n\nwe can conclude that if \\emph{p} is a prime larger than 4, then its\nsquare is always 1 mod 6."
