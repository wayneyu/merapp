        "We want to find two eigenvectors of\n\n\\begin{align*}\nA=\\begin{bmatrix}\n2  &  1  &  1\\\\\n1  &  2  &  1\\\\\n1  &  1  &  2\n\\end{bmatrix}\\end{align*}\n\nwith eigenvalue $\\lambda=1$. Just like in\n\\href{Science:Math_Exam_Resources/Courses/MATH152/April_2010/Question_B2_(a)}{B2(a)}\nwe want to find the vectors $\\mathbf{x}=[a,b,c]^T$ such that\n\n\\begin{align*}\n(A-1I)\\mathbf{x}=\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1  &  1  &  1\\\\\n1  & 1  &  1\\\\\n1  &  1  & 1\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\begin{bmatrix}\na\\\\\nb\\\\\nc\n\\end{bmatrix}\n=\\mathbf{0}\\end{align*}\n\nWe therefore have three equations with three unknowns\n\n\\begin{align*}\na+b+c&=0\\\\\na+b+c&=0\\\\\na+b+c&=0\\end{align*}\n\nNotice that these are all the same equation, therefore we effectively\nonly have one equation. Notice that if we row reduced the matrix\n$(A-1I)\\mathbf{x}$ we'd get two rows of all zeros, corresponding exactly\nto the situation of having repeated linear equations. This tells us that\ntwo of the variables will be free parameters. Contrast this to\n\\href{Science:Math_Exam_Resources/Courses/MATH152/April_2010/Question_B2_(a)}{B2(a)}\nwhere we had only one free parameter in the end. The emergence of two\nfree parameters tells us that there will be two eigenvectors. We will\ntake the two free parameters to be a and b, though you can pick any two\nof a,b, and c to be the free parameters.\n\n\\textbf{First Eigenvector: a=1, b=0}\n\nTo find the first eigenvector we will use set the first free parameter\nto 1 and the second to 0 (a=1,b=0). Note that you can pick any values\nyou want (except for a=0,b=0 because that will lead to the eigenvector\nbeing zero).\n\nWith a=1 and b=0 we have\n\n\\begin{align*}\na+b+c=1+0+c=0\\end{align*}\n\nand therefore, c=-1. Therefore the first eigenvector for the eigenvalue\n1 is\n\n\\begin{align*}\n\\mathbf{x}_1=\\begin{bmatrix}\n1\\\\\n0\\\\\n-1\n\\end{bmatrix}.\\end{align*}\n\n\\textbf{Second Eigenvector: a=0, b=1}\n\nTo find the second eigenvector we will use set the first free parameter\nto 0 and the second to 1 (a=0,b=1). Note that you can pick any values\nyou want (except for a=0,b=0 because that will lead to the eigenvector\nbeing zero) as long as they are different from the first values you\nchose, otherwise you will get the same eigenvector.\n\nWith a=0 and b=1 we have\n\n\\begin{align*}\na+b+c=0+1+c=0\\end{align*}\n\nand once again, c=-1. Therefore the second eigenvector for the\neigenvalue 1 is\n\n\\begin{align*}\n\\mathbf{x}_2=\\begin{bmatrix}\n0\\\\\n1\\\\\n-1\n\\end{bmatrix}.\\end{align*}\n\nAny non-trivial linear combination of these two vectors is also an\neigenvector, which you can easily verify."
