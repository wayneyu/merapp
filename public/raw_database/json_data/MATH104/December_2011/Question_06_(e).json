    "statement": "In this problem, you will approximate $\\ln(0.9)$ in two ways: one using\nlinear approximation and the other using quadratic approximation. You\nmay find it useful to draw the graph of $\\ln(x)$ for $x$ near 1 to help\nyou answer some parts of this question.\n\ne) Compare the error bound for the linear approximation to $\\ln(0.9)$\nyou found in part (b) to the magnitude of the 2nd degree term of the\nquadratic approximation to $\\ln(0.9)$. Which do you expect to be larger\nand why?",

        "We expect that the error term will be larger than or equal to the\nmagnitude of the second-order term in the quadratic approximation. The\nreason for this is because the two terms have a similar form, but in the\nerror, the $M$ term replaces the $\\displaystyle{}f''(a)$ term in the\nquadratic correction, where $M$ is the maximum value of\n$\\displaystyle{}|f''(x)|$ on the interval $[0.9,1]$. Indeed the error\nterm was greater than the magnitude of the quadratic correction term in\nthe quadratic approximation: (1/162 = 0.0061... \\textgreater{} 0.005)"
