    "statement": "Consider a solid whose base in the xy-plane is the finite region bounded\nby the curves $y = x^2$ and $y = 2 - x^2$. The cross sections of the\nsolid perpendicular to the x-axis with one side in the xy-plane are\nsquares. Find the volume of this solid.",

        "If we follow the hint, we can draw a diagram similar to the one pictured\non the right \\includegraphics[width=.5\\textwidth]{Math101Apr20112b.png}. We have drawn the\naxis so that we see the $xy$ plane in its familiar 2D position.\\\\The\nfirst thing we have to consider is the $x$ limits of where our picture\nbegins and ends. To do this, we find the intersection points of our two\nparabolas. Therefore we want to find the $x$ such\nthat\\\\$\\displaystyle{}x^2=2-x^2$\\\\which occurs when $x=\\pm{1}$. Notice\nfrom our diagram that $x=-1$ is the left endpoint and $x=1$ is the right\nendpoint. As we are told in the question, the cross section in the\n$z$-direction is a square which we can think of as a rectangular prism\nwith a very small depth, $\\textrm{d}x$. Therefore, the volume of any one\nsquare, $\\textrm{d}V$, is given\nby\\\\$\\displaystyle{}\\textrm{d}V=bh\\textrm{d}x.$\\\\Since the cross section\nis indeed a square we have that $b=h$ and this equals the height between\nthe two parabolas.\nTherefore,\\\\$\\displaystyle{}b=h=(2-x^2)-x^2=2-2x^2$\\\\and thus for any\n$x$ we have that the volume of the rectangle\nis,\\\\$\\displaystyle{}\\textrm{d}V=h^2\\textrm{d}x=(2-2x^2)^2\\textrm{d}x=4(1-x^2)^2\\textrm{d}x.$\\\\To\nget the total volume we have to add up all the little square volumes\nthat we would sweep out from the start of our figure at $x=-1$ to the\nend at $x=1$. However, there are an infinite number of $x$ values in\nthis range and so what would normally be a sum, we write as an integral.\nTherefore,\\begin{align*}\nV&=\\int\\textrm{d}V=\\int_{-1}^14(1-x^2)^2\\textrm{d}x\\\\\n&=4\\int_{-1}^1(x^4-2x^2+1)\\textrm{d}x\\\\\n&=\\frac{64}{15}.\n\\end{align*}\nTherefore, the volume of the solid is $V=\\frac{64}{15}$."
