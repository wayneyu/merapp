        "A picture is included below.\n\nFirst, we try to find the points of intersection. To do this, make the\ntwo curves equal so\n\n$\\displaystyle\n2x^{2} = 4 + x^{2}$\n\nand solving for \\emph{x} gives\n\n$\\displaystyle\nx = \\pm 2.$\n\nNow, from the picture (or by plugging in $x=0$ into both curves), it is\nclear that $4 + x^{2}$ is the top most curve. Hence, we need to compute\n\n$A = \\int_{-2}^{2} (4 + x^{2} - 2x^{2}) \\, dx= \\int_{-2}^{2} (4 - x^{2}) \\, dx = 2\\int_{0}^{2}(4-x^{2})\\, dx$\n\nwhere the last equality holds above since the function is an even\nfunction over a symmetric interval. Thus,\n\n$A  = 2\\int_{0}^{2}(4-x^{2})\\, dx = \\left. (8x - \\frac{2x^{3}}{3})\\right|_{0}^{2} = 16 - \\frac{16}{3} = \\frac{32}{3}$\n\ncompleting the question.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htbp]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=.5\\textwidth]{MATH101Apr2008Q2a.jpeg}\n\\caption{MATH101Apr2008Q2a.jpeg}\n\\end{figure}"
