        "Assume that the solution $y=y(x)$ has a Taylor series expansion about\n$x=0,$\n\n\\[y = a_0 + a_1x + a_2x^2 + a_3x^3 + \\dots = \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty a_n x^n.\\]\n\nWe'll use the initial condition and the differential equation to solve\nfor the coeffients.\n\nFrom the initial condition,\n\n\\[1 = y(0) =  a_0 + a_1(0) + a_2(0)^2 + a_3(0)^3 + \\dots = a_0.\\]\n\nLet's start with the left hand side \\emph{dy/dx} of the differential\nequation \\emph{dy/dx = y-x}. Differentiating the series for \\emph{y}\nterm by term yields\n\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{dy}{dx}&= 0 + a_1 + 2a_2x + 3a_3x^2 + 4a_4x^3 + \\dots \\\\\n&=\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty a_n nx^{n-1} \\\\\n&= \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty a_{k+1} (k+1) x^{k} \\\\\n&= \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty a_{n+1} (n+1) x^{n} \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\nHere we substituted the dummy variable \\emph{n} = \\emph{k}+1, (i.e.\n\\emph{k} = \\emph{n}-1) in the third step, and then renamed \\emph{k} as\n\\emph{n}. (This substitution of dummy variable was done purely for\n\\textless{}\\textgreater{} to be able to compare the two Taylor series of\nthe LHS and the RHS of the differential equation more easily. In general\nit helps with both series start with \\emph{n} = 0.)\n\nThe right hand side \\emph{y-x} of the differential equation \\emph{dy/dx\n= y-x} gives\n\n\\begin{align*}\ny-x &= a_0 + (a_1-1)x + a_2x^2 + a_3x^3 + \\dots \\\\\n&= a_0 + (a_1-1)x + \\sum_{n=2}^\\infty a_n x^n.\n\\end{align*}\n\nNow we can equate the left hand side with the right hand side of the\ndifferential equation to get\n\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{dy}{dx}\u00c2\u00a0&= y-x \\\\\n{\\color{green} a_1} + {\\color{red} 2a_2x} + {\\color{blue} 3a_3x^2} + {\\color{magenta} 4a_4x^3} + \\dots &= {\\color{green} a_0} + {\\color{red} (a_1-1)x} + {\\color{blue} a_2x^2} + {\\color{magenta} a_3x^3} + \\dots \\\\\n{\\color{green} a_1} + {\\color{red} 2a_2x} + \\sum_{n=2}^\\infty a_{n+1} (n+1) x^{n} &= {\\color{green} a_0} + {\\color{red} (a_1-1)x} + \\sum_{n=2}^\\infty a_n x^n.\n\\end{align*}\n\nFrom the differential equation, we can equate each of the coefficients\nof the above series.\n\nFor $n=0,$ (i.e. the coefficients in from of\n\\emph{x}\\textsuperscript{0}) we have\n${\\color{green} a_1} = {\\color{green} a_0} = 1.$\n\nFor $n=1,$ (i.e. the coefficients in from of\n\\emph{x}\\textsuperscript{1})\n${\\color{red} 2a_2} = {\\color{red} a_1-1} = 0,$ hence, $a_2=0.$\n\nFor all $n\\geq 2,$ $a_{n+1} (n+1) = a_n$.\n\nThat is, $a_{n+1}  = \\frac{a_n}{n+1}.$ For example,\n${\\color{blue} a_3} = {\\color{blue} a_2/3} = 0.$ Similarly,\n${\\color{magenta} a_4} = {\\color{magenta} a_3/3} = 0.$ We can see that\nfor all $n\\geq 3,$ $a_n=0.$\n\nHence, the solution is\n\n\\[\\displaystyle y=1+x.\\]\n\n\\emph{Note:} We can easily check that this is indeed a solution to the\ninitial value problem\\[y(0)=1+0=1\\] and\n\\emph{dy/dx}=1=\\emph{y}-\\emph{x}."
