        "The column space is the same as the range of the matrix, which we know\nhas has dimension 3, thus we are looking for a basis made up of 3\nelements.\n\nWhile row operations (or left multiplication by an invertible matrix)\nchanges the column space, it still preserves the relations among the\ncolumns. The reason for this being is that left matrix multiplication\nacts on the columns of a matrix as if they were vectors, thus, for\nexample, if $c_1$ is the first column of a matrix \\emph{B}, then $Mc_1$\nis the first column of the matrix $MB$, furthermore if we had\n$c_1 = c_2 + c_3$, a relationship among the columns of \\emph{A}, then\n$Mc_1 = Mc_2 + Mc_3$ will be a relationship in the columns of $MA$.\nSince \\emph{M} is invertible you can reverse this step, so that linearly\nindependent columns in \\emph{B} correspond to linearly independent\ncolumns in \\emph{A}.\n\nDue to this fact, we can read the relations that the columns of the\nmatrix \\emph{A} by looking at those off of the matrix \\emph{B}, in\nparticular we can simply read which column of \\emph{A} are linear\nindependent by looking at the columns of \\emph{B} that contain a pivot\n(i.e. a set of columns that is linearly independent in \\emph{B}).\n\nThe column space of \\emph{A} has a basis equal to\n$\\left[ \\begin{array}{c}\n1 \\\\ \n3 \\\\ \n2 \\\\\n2 \\\\\n\\end{array} \\right], \\left[ \\begin{array}{c}\n2 \\\\ \n4 \\\\ \n3 \\\\\n2 \\\\\n\\end{array} \\right] , \\left[ \\begin{array}{c}\n3 \\\\ \n0 \\\\ \n1 \\\\\n-3 \\\\\n\\end{array} \\right]$."
