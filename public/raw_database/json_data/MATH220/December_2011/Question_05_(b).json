        "The core idea of this solution is to say that if the set \\emph{A} is\ndenumerable, then we can remove any element \\emph{a} from this set and\nobtain a proper subset which is also denumerable. We will show below how\nto precisely prove that this subset is denumerable.\n\nSince the set \\emph{A} is denumerable, there exists a bijection from\nthat set to the set of natural numbers. Let $f$ be this bijection, that is\n\n\\begin{align*}f : A \\to \\mathbb{N}\\end{align*}\n\nLet \\emph{a} be the element of the set \\emph{A} which is mapped to the\ninteger 1, that is\n\n\\begin{align*}\\displaystyle\na = f^{-1}(1)\\end{align*} Then define the set \\emph{B} to be the subset containing\nall the elements of the set \\emph{A} except for the element \\emph{a},\nthat is\n\n\\begin{align*}\\displaystyle\nB = A\\backslash\\{a\\}\\end{align*} Note that \\emph{B} is a proper subset of\n\\emph{A}. To show this subset is denumerable, define a function $g$ to\nthe natural numbers as follow\n\n\\begin{align*}\ng : B &\\to \\mathbb{N} \\\\\nb &\\mapsto f(b)-1\\end{align*}\n\nNotice that each element of the set \\emph{B} is mapped by $f$ to an\ninteger greater or equal to 2 (since we removed \\emph{a} who precisely\nwas the integer mapped to 1), so the function \\emph{g} simply assigns\nthe natural number just below. We claim that this $g$ is bijective.\n\nTo show surjectivity, notice that each natural number \\emph{m} is the\nimage by the function \\emph{g} of the element which was mapped to\n\\emph{m}+1 by the function $f$. We can write this as\n\n\\begin{align*}\\displaystyle\nm = g(f^{-1}(m+1))\\end{align*}\n\nFor injectivity, suppose that you have elements \\emph{b} and''b'''of\nthe set \\emph{B}such that\n\n\\begin{align*}\\displaystyle\ng(b) = g(b')\\end{align*} By definition of the function \\emph{g} this means that\n\n\\begin{align*}\\displaystyle\nf(b)-1 = f(b')-1\\end{align*} and so that\n\n\\begin{align*}\\displaystyle\nf(b) = f(b')\\end{align*} And since we know that the function $f$ is a bijection (and\nin particular is injective) we can conclude that \\emph{b = b',} and thus\nthe function \\emph{g} is injective.\n\nSince \\emph{g} is both surjective and injective it is a bijection and\nthus the set \\emph{B} is denumerable.", 
        "Another way to find a denumerable proper subset goes as follow:\n\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\itemsep1pt\\parskip0pt\\parsep0pt\n\\item\n  use the fact that the set \\emph{A} has a bijection with the natural\n  numbers to define a proper subset of all the elements mapped to an\n  even natural number,\n\\item\n  realize that this will be a proper and denumerable subset of the set\n  \\emph{A}.\n\\end{itemize}\n\nDetails of this proof are described here.\n\nSince the set \\emph{A} is denumerable there must exist a bijection\n\\emph{g}: \\emph{A} \u2192 \\textbf{N} from that set to the natural numbers. We\ndefine the set \\emph{B} to be all the elements of the set \\emph{A} that\nare mapped to an even number, that is\n\n\\begin{align*}\\displaystyle\nB = \\{ a \\in A \\mid g(a) \\text{ is even} \\}\\end{align*}\n\nWe need to show that the set \\emph{B} is a proper subset of \\emph{A} and\nis denumerable. It is a proper subset since it doesn't contain any\nelement that are mapped to an odd number. To show it is denumerable, we\ndefine the function\n\n\\begin{align*}\nh: B &\\to \\mathbb{N}\\\\\nb &\\mapsto \\frac{g(b)}{2}\\end{align*} and show that it is a bijection.\n\nIt is surjective since for any natural number \\emph{m} there is an\nelement of the set \\emph{A} which maps to the number 2\\emph{m} and since\nthat's an even integer, that element of the set \\emph{A} is a member of\nthe subset \\emph{B}, let's call it \\emph{b} for now. Then since\n\\emph{g}(\\emph{b}) = 2\\emph{m}, then \\emph{h}(\\emph{b}) = \\emph{m} and\nthus the function \\emph{h} is surjective.\n\nTo show injectivity, consider two elements \\emph{b} and''b'''of the\nset \\emph{B} such that\n\n\\begin{align*}\\displaystyle\nh(b) = h(b')\\end{align*} by definition of the function \\emph{h} we have that\n\n\\begin{align*}\\displaystyle\n\\frac{g(b)}{2} = \\frac{g(b')}{2}\\end{align*} and thus\n\n\\begin{align*}\\displaystyle\ng(b) = g(b')\\end{align*} but since \\emph{g} is a bijection, it is also an\ninjection and we can conclude that \\emph{b} = \\emph{b',} and so the\nfunction \\emph{h} is injective."
