        "First, we prove the claim true when $n = 1$. In this case,\n\n\\begin{align*}\\displaystyle 12^{2n-1} + 11^{n+1} = 12^{2(1)-1} + 11^{1+1} = 12 + 121 = 133\\end{align*}\n\nwhich is clearly divisible by 133. We assume the claim is true for\n$n=k$. For $n = k +1$, we have\n\n\\begin{align*}\n12^{2(k+1)-1} + 11^{(k+1)+1} &= 12^{2k+1} + 11^{k+2}\\\\\n&= 12^{2}\\cdot12^{2k-1} + 11\\cdot 11^{k+1}\\\\\n&= 144\\cdot12^{2k-1} + 11\\cdot 11^{k+1}\\\\\n&= (133+11)12^{2k-1} + 11\\cdot 11^{k+1}\\\\\n&= 133\\cdot12^{2k-1}+11\\cdot12^{2k-1} + 11\\cdot 11^{k+1}\\\\\n&= 133\\cdot12^{2k-1}+11(12^{2k-1} + 11^{k+1})\\end{align*}\n\nNow, in the last line, the first summand is divisible by 133 and the\nsecond summand is also divisible by 133 by the induction hypothesis.\nHence we must have that $12^{2(k+1)-1} + 11^{(k+1)+1}$ is divisible by\n133 as required."
