        "Setting the derivative to 0 and solving gives\n\n$0 = 4x^{3} - 12x^2 + 8x = 4x(x^2-3x + 2) = 4x(x-1)(x-2)$\n\nand thus, the steady states are $x=0,1,2$. At the point a, the\nderivative is positive and so the function $x(t)$ is increasing and thus\napproaches the steady state 1 (the first steady states bigger than a).\nAt \\emph{b}, the dervative is negative hence the function is negative\nand thus approaches the steady state 1. At \\emph{c}, the derivative is\npositive and so the function is increasing and as \\emph{t} approaches\ninfinity, the function $x(t)$ approaches infinity.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htbp]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=.5\\textwidth]{M103W2013Q5b.jpg}\n\\caption{M103W2013Q5b.jpg}\n\\end{figure}"

        "At points \\emph{a},\\emph{b} and \\emph{c} to see what happens as time\napproaches infinity, you need to know whether the derivative is positive\n(hence the function is increasing) or negative (hence the function is\ndecreasing)."
