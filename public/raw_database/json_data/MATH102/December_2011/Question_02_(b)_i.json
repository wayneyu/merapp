Note that\n\n\\[\\frac{dy}{dt}=y^3-y^2-2y = y( y^2-y-2) = y( y-2)(y+1).\\] The roots are\nat 0, 2 and -1.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htbp]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=.5\\textwidth]{M102graph.jpg}\n\\caption{A graph of $\\frac{dy}{dt}$ vs. $y$}\n\\end{figure}\n\nWe are given that y(0)=1, which is in between 0 and 2. In this region,\n$y$ and $y+1$ are both positive and $y-2$ is negative. Therefore,\n$\\frac{dy}{dt}<0$, which means that $y$ is decreasing (throughout the\ninterval (0,2)). As $y$ approaches zero, we see that $\\frac{dy}{dt}$\nalso approaches zero. (Note that $y$ could never cross zero, since\n$\\frac{dy}{dt}=0$ at the point where $y=0$. In other words, if $y$ ever\nhits 0, it stays there!)\n\nTherefore,\n\n\\[\\lim_{t\\to\\infty} y(t)=0.\\]"
