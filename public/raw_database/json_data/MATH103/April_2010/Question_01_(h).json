        "Saying that \\emph{y(t)} does not change any more is the same as saying\nthat \\emph{y(t)} is constant. A function is constant if its derivative\n$\\frac{dy}{dt}$ is equal to 0. So we look for values of $y$ that satisfy\n$0=1-4y^2$. This equation only holds for $y=\\pm 1/2$.\n\nHence the the right answer is \\textbf{v}.\n\n(Note: The answer \\emph{y=-1/2} is not a choice here because of the\ninitial condition \\emph{y(0)=0}. The solution of the differential\nequation starts at \\emph{y=0} and then increases to \\emph{y=1/2}. With a\ndifferent initial condition the other equilibrium \\emph{y=-1/2} would be\napproached.)"
