        "From\n\\href{Science:Math Exam Resources/Courses/MATH100/December 2011/Question 5 (c)}{part\n(c)}, we know that\n\n\\begin{align*}\nf''(x) &= \\frac{6(x-4)}{25x^{9/5}}\\end{align*}\n\nNotice that the potential inflection points are at \\emph{x}=0,4, where\n$f''(x)$ is either zero or undefined. Doing a sign chart for this\nfunction yields the following. When \\emph{x \\textless{} 0} we have that\n$f''(x) > 0$. When $0 < x < 4$ we have that $f''(x) < 0$. When $x > 4$\nwe have that $f''(x) > 0$. Hence, the function is concave up on\n$(-\\infty, 0) \\cup (4,\\infty)$.\n\n\\emph{Note: Since the sign of $f''(x)$ changes at both points, both\n$x=0$ and $x=4$ are inflection points. Even though $f''(x)$ is not\ndefined at $x = 0$.}"
