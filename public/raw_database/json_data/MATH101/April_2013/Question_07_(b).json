        "We want to be able to use part (a), so we need some way of converting\nthe polynomial into something involving trigonometric functions. In\nparticular, recall that\n\n$\\displaystyle \\tan^2 \\theta +1 = \\sec^2 \\theta$\n\nso let's try the substitution $\\displaystyle x = \\tan \\theta$, so\n$\\displaystyle dx = \\sec^2 \\theta \\ d\\theta$, and the boundaries of\nintegration change according to\n$\\displaystyle x = -1 = \\tan\\theta \\Rightarrow \\theta = -\\pi/4$ and\n$\\displaystyle x = 1 =\\tan \\theta \\Rightarrow \\theta =  \\pi/4$. Then,\nusing symmetry at the end, as the resulting function is even, we see\nthat\n\n\\begin{align*}\n\\int_{-1}^{1} \\frac{dx}{(x^2+1)^3} &= \\int_{-\\pi/4}^{\\pi/4} \\frac{\\sec^2\\theta}{(\\tan^2\\theta+1)^3} \\ d\\theta \\\\\n&= \\int_{-\\pi/4}^{\\pi/4} \\frac{\\sec^2\\theta}{(\\sec^2\\theta)^3} \\ d\\theta \\\\\n&= \\int_{-\\pi/4}^{\\pi/4} \\frac{\\sec^2\\theta}{\\sec^6\\theta} \\ d\\theta \\\\\n&= \\int_{-\\pi/4}^{\\pi/4} \\frac{1}{\\sec^4\\theta} \\ d\\theta \\\\\n&= \\int_{-\\pi/4}^{\\pi/4} \\cos^4\\theta \\ d\\theta \\\\\n&= 2\\int_{0}^{\\pi/4} \\cos^4\\theta \\ d\\theta \\\\\n&= 2\\left(\\frac{8+3\\pi}{32}\\right) \\\\\n&= \\frac{8+3\\pi}{16}\\end{align*}"
