        "The intervals of decrease are the intervals on which the derivative of\nthe function $f$ is negative. Given that\n\n\\begin{align*}\nf'(x) &= \\frac{6}{5}x^{-4/5} + \\frac{6}{5}x^{1/5} \\\\\n&= \\frac{6x^{-4/5}(1+x)}{5} \\\\\n&= \\frac{6(x+1)}{5x^{4/5}}\\end{align*}\n\nOur critical points occur when $x=-1,0$, that is, points on the function\nwhere the derivative is undefined or zero. Writing out a sign chart, we\nsee that when $x< -1$ we have that $f'(x) < 0$. When $-1 < x< 0$ we have\nthat $f'(x) > 0$. When $0 < x$ we have that $f'(x) > 0$. Hence the\nfunction is decreasing on $(-\\infty,-1)$."
