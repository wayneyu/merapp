        "First we show that the Mobius function is multiplicative. Let \\emph{m}\nand \\emph{n} be coprime integers. Then let\n\n$\\displaystyle m = \\prod_{i=1}^{M} p_{i}^{\\alpha_{i}}$\n\nand\n\n$\\displaystyle n = \\prod_{j=1}^{N} q_{j}^{\\beta_{j}}$.\n\nWe wish to show that $\\displaystyle \\mu(mn) = \\mu(m)\\mu(n)$. Clearly, if\n\\emph{m} or \\emph{n} contains a square prime factor, then both sides\nevaluate to 0 so without loss of generality, suppose that each\n$\\displaystyle \\alpha_{i},\\beta_{j} = 1$. We break into cases based on\nthe number of prime factors.\n\n\\textbf{Case 1: \\emph{M} and \\emph{N} are both odd or both even.}. In\nthese cases, $\\displaystyle \\mu(mn) = 1$. Now, since the number of prime\nfactors are both odd or both even, we have that\n$\\displaystyle \\mu(m) = \\mu(n)$ and since these are now either plus or\nminus 1 (we've eliminated the case when the Mobius function is 0 on\neither side), we have\n\n$\\displaystyle \\mu(mn) = 1 = \\mu(m)^{2} = \\mu(m)\\mu(n)$\n\n\\textbf{Case 2: \\emph{M} and \\emph{N} are of opposite parity.}. Suppose\nthat \\emph{M} is even (the argument is symmetric). In this case\n$\\displaystyle \\mu(mn) = -1$ since we have an odd number of factors.\nNow, we have that $\\displaystyle \\mu(m) =-1$ and\n$\\displaystyle \\mu(n) = 1$. Thus,\n\n$\\displaystyle \\mu(mn) = -1 = \\mu(m)\\mu(n)$\n\nHence the Mobius function is multiplicative.\n\nNow, let $\\displaystyle S(n) = \\sum_{d \\mid n}\\mu(d)$. I claim that this\nfunction is also multiplicative. For this, again let \\emph{m} and\n\\emph{n} be coprime integers (notice that $\\displaystyle S(1) = 1$). We\nsee that\n\n$\\displaystyle S(m)S(n) = \\sum_{d \\mid m}\\mu(d) \\sum_{e \\mid n}\\mu(e) = \\sum_{d \\mid m}\\sum_{e \\mid n}\\mu(d)\\mu(e)\n= \\sum_{d \\mid m}\\sum_{e \\mid n}\\mu(de)$\n\nNow as \\emph{m} and \\emph{n} are coprime, we see that for any divisor\n$\\displaystyle h \\mid mn$, we can write $\\displaystyle h$ uniquely of\nthe form $\\displaystyle h = de$ where $\\displaystyle d \\mid m$ and\n$\\displaystyle e \\mid n$ and vice versa. Thus, we have\n\n$\\displaystyle S(m)S(n) = \\sum_{d \\mid m}\\sum_{e \\mid n}\\mu(de) = \\sum_{h \\mid mn}\\mu(h) = S(mn)$\n\nshowing that this function is also multiplicative. So, by\nmultiplicativity, it suffices to show that\n\n$\\displaystyle S(p^{a}) = 0$ where \\emph{p} is a prime and \\emph{a} is\nan integer. Here, we have\n\n$\\displaystyle S(p^{a}) = \\sum_{d \\mid p^{a}}\\mu(d) = \\sum_{i=0}^{a}\\mu(p^{i}) = \\mu(1) + \\mu(p) + \\sum_{i=2}^{a}\\mu(p^{i})$.\n\nNotice that the last sum might be non-existent if \\emph{a} is 1. In any\ncase, the last sum evaluates to 0 since all the terms contain a\n$\\displaystyle p^{2}$ factor. Notice that\n$\\displaystyle \\mu(1)  +\\mu(p) = 1 - 1 = 0$ and so\n$\\displaystyle S(p^{a}) = 0$ so long as \\emph{a} is not 0 (which is\nallowed since \\emph{n} was an integer greater than 1). Thus we have a\nmultiplicative function which evaluates to 0 on all prime powers, hence\nit must be zero for all values greater than 1 since\n\n$\\displaystyle S(n) = S\\left(\\prod_{j=1}^{N}q_{j}\\right) = \\prod_{j=1}^{N}S\\left(q_{j}\\right) = 0$.\n\nThis completes the proof."

        "Recall that the Mobius function is the function that evaluates to 1 if\n\\emph{n} is square-free and has an even number of prime factors, -1 if\n\\emph{n} is square-free and has an odd number of factors, and 0 if\n\\emph{n} has a square factor.\n\nFirst show/recall that the Mobius function is multiplicative.", 
        "Let $\\displaystyle S(n) = \\sum_{d \\mid n}\\mu(d)$. Show that this\nfunction is multiplicative then evaluate it on prime powers.\n\nNote: One could solve this problem by a more direct approach however\nlearning about the theory of multiplicative functions is quite important\nand worth doing."
