        "To find the equation of the tangent line to \\emph{y} =\n\\emph{x}\\textsuperscript{3.5} - \\emph{e}\\textsuperscript{3.5} at the\npoint (\\emph{e, 0} ), we must first find the derivative of the curve,\nwhich is the slope of the tangent line at that point.\n\nFirst we use the difference rule to separate the two terms.\n\n\\[\\frac{d}{dx}(x^{3.5}-e^{3.5})\n=\\frac{d}{dx}(x^{3.5})-\\frac{d}{dx}(e^{3.5})\\]\n\nThe next step is to recognize that \\emph{e}\\textsuperscript{3.5} is a\nconstant, so we know that its derivative is equal to 0 and we can remove\nthat term altogether from the equation. Then we use to power rule to\ndifferentiate \\emph{x}\\textsuperscript{3.5} :\n\n\\[\\frac{d}{dx}(x^{3.5})\n=3.5x^{3.5-1}\n=3.5x^{2.5}\\]\n\nBy plugging in \\emph{x} = \\emph{e} into the derivative, we find the\ntangent line at the desired point (\\emph{e}, 0), we get the slope\n\\emph{m} of the tangent line of equation\n\\emph{y}-\\emph{y}\\textsubscript{0} = \\emph{m}(\\emph{x} -\n\\emph{x}\\textsubscript{0})\n\n\\[\\displaystyle\nm=3.5(e^{2.5})\\]\n\nFrom this we can conclude that the equation of the line is:\n\n\\[\\displaystyle\ny-y_0=m(x-x_0) \\quad\\Rightarrow\\quad y-0=3.5e^{2.5}(x-e)\\] Simplifying,\nwe get\n\n\\[\\displaystyle\ny=3.5e^{2.5}(x-e)\\] or\n\n\\[\\displaystyle\ny=3.5e^{2.5}x-3.5e^{3.5}\\]"
