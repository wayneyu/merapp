    "statement": "A racing car travels along the ellipse\n\n\\begin{align*}\\displaystyle{}x^2+2y^2=9\\end{align*}\n\nwhere x and y are measured in kilometers. When the car is at the point\n(1,2), the x-coordinate of the point is changing at the rate of 3\nkilometers per minute. How fast is the y-coordinate changing at that\nmoment?",

    "sols": [
        "We have that\n\n\\begin{align*}x(t)^2+2y(t)^2=9\\end{align*}\n\nand we want to find dy/dt when x=1, y=2 and dx/dt=3. Therefore, we\nimplicitly differentiate and isolate for dy/dt,\n\n\\begin{align*}\n2x\\frac{\\textrm{d}x}{\\textrm{d}t}+4y\\frac{\\textrm{d}y}{\\textrm{d}t}&=0\\\\\n\\frac{\\textrm{d}y}{\\textrm{d}t}&=-\\frac{x}{2y}\\frac{\\textrm{d}x}{\\textrm{d}t}.\\end{align*}\n\nWe then sub in x=1, y=2, and dx/dt=3 to get that\n\n\\begin{align*}\\left.\\frac{\\textrm{d}y}{\\textrm{d}t}\\right|_{x=1,y=2}=-\\frac{1}{4}(3)=-\\frac{3}{4}\\end{align*}\n\nand so we conclude that the y-coordinate is changing at -3/4 kilometers\nper minute at that moment."
