        "Given the equation\n\n\\[\\displaystyle{}2u'' + 2 \\gamma u' + 18 u = 0,\\]\n\nwe can obtain the characteristic equation by substituting a solution\n\n\\[\\displaystyle{}u(t)=\\exp(rt)\\]\n\nand looking at the resulting polynomial. Doing this we get\n\n\\[\\displaystyle{}2r^2 + 2 \\gamma r + 18 = 0\\]\n\nwhich has roots\n\n\\begin{align*}\nr &= \\frac{-2\\gamma \\pm \\sqrt{4 \\gamma^2 - 4(2)(18)}}{4} \\\\\n&= -\\frac{\\gamma}{2} \\pm \\frac{\\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 36}}{2} \\\\\n&= \\frac12\\left(-\\gamma \\pm \\sqrt{\\gamma^2-6^2}\\right)\n\\end{align*}.\n\nNow we study the behaviour of the roots of the equation. Note that\n$\\gamma > 0$ is necessary for physical damping.\n\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\itemsep1pt\\parskip0pt\\parsep0pt\n\\item\n  When $\\gamma^2 - 36 < 0$, there are complex roots to the system, and\n  there are oscillations. Thus the system is \\emph{underdamped}.\n\\item\n  When $\\gamma^2 - 36 > 0$, the square root always yields a real value.\n  Since $\\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 36} < \\gamma$ (assuming $\\gamma>0$), it\n  follows that both roots are negative (so the amplitude decays) and\n  real (so there are no oscillations). Thus, the system is\n  \\emph{overdamped}.\n\\end{itemize}\n\nThus, there is overdamping for $\\gamma > 6$ and underdamping for\n$\\gamma < 6$ (and therefore critical damping if $\\gamma=6$)."
