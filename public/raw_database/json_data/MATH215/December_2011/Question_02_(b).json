        "By differentiating $M(x,y) = 0$ with respect to x, we arrive at\n$M_x + M_y \\frac{dy}{dx} = 0$ and we identify\n\n\\begin{align*}\nM_x &= 3x^2 y + 8xy^2\\\\\nM_y &= x^3 + 8x^2y + 12y^2.\n\\end{align*}\n\nBy computing\n\n\\[\\displaystyle{}M_{xy} = M_{yx} = 3x^2 + 16xy\\]\n\nwe see that it is exact and hence partial integration can be used to\nsolve it. Note that if\n\n\\[\\displaystyle{}M_x = 3x^2 y + 8x y^2\\]\n\nthen by integrating partially with respect to $x$, we have\n\n\\[\\displaystyle{}M = x^3 y + 4x^2 y^2 + f(y)\\]\n\nfor some function $f$ that does not depend on $x$. If we differentiate\n\n\\[\\displaystyle{}M = x^3 y + 4x^2 y^2 + f(y)\\]\n\nwith respect to $y$ keeping $x$ constant then\n\n\\[\\displaystyle{}M_y = x^3 + 8x^2 y + f'(y) = x^3 + 8x^2 y + 12y^2\\]\n\nfrom our initial observations. We therefore find\n\n\\[\\displaystyle{}f'(y) = 12y^2\\]\n\nso that $f(y) = 4y^3 + C$ for an arbitrary constant C.\n\nTherefore,\n\n\\[\\displaystyle{}M(x,y) = x^3 y + 4x^2 y^2 + 4y^3 + C = 0\\]\n\nis the general solution to the ODE."

        "This equation is exact (you should verify). To solve it, ``partial\nintegration'' may be useful."
