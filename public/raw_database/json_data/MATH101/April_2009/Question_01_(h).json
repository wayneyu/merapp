    "statement": "For what values of $r$ does the function $y = x^r$ satisfy the following\ndifferential equation (for $x > 0$)?\n\n\\[\\displaystyle\nx^2 y'' + 4xy' + 2y = 0\\]",

        "When $y  = x^{r}$, we know that $y' = rx^{r-1}$ and\n$y'' = r(r-1)x^{r-2}$. Hence, we have\n\n\\begin{align*}\n0 &= x^2 y'' + 4xy' + 2y \\\\\n&= x^2 (r(r-1)x^{r-2} ) + 4x(rx^{r-1}) + 2x^{r} \\\\\n&= (r^{2}-r)x^{r} + 4rx^{r} + 2x^{r} \\\\\n&= (r^{2}+3r+2)x^{r}\n\\end{align*}\n\nNow, since $x > 0$ always, we must have that the coefficient of $x^{r}$\nabove has to be 0. Thus, we solve\n\n\\[\\displaystyle\n0 = r^{2}+3r+2 = (r+1)(r+2)\\]\n\nand so $r = -1$ and $r = -2$ completing the question."
