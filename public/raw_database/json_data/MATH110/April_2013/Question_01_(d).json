    "hints": [
        "Try known examples of functions with vertical asymptotes at 0 and look\nat their reciprocal functions. This should give you the intuition of\nthis question.\n\nOne can also look at this abstractly by recalling the definition of what\nit means to have a vertical asymptote and how this would affect the\nreciprocal function, but trying examples should be sufficient."
