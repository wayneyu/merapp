Simplification of answers is not required\nunless explicitly stated.}\n\nA wealthy man was found murdered in his home. The police arrived on\nscene at 10:00 P.M. The temperature of the body at 10:00 P.M. was\n33$^{\\circ}$C and one hour later it was 31$^{\\circ}$C. The temperature\nof the room in which the body was found was 21$^{\\circ}$C and normal\nbody temperature is 37$^{\\circ}$C. Assume that the body cools after\ndeath according to Newton's Law of Cooling.\n\nHow many hours before the police arrived on the scene did the murder\noccur?",

        "Newton's Law of Cooling which states that\n\n\\[\\displaystyle\nT(t)=T_a+(T_0-T_a)e^{-kt}.\\] Here, the initial temperature of the body\n\\emph{T}\\textsubscript{0} is 33$^{\\circ}$C; the temperature of the\nenvironment \\emph{T}\\textsubscript{a} is given to be 21$^{\\circ}$C; and\nthe temperature of the body after 1 hour (\\emph{T}(1)) is 31$^{\\circ}$C.\nPlugging in these numbers give us\n\n\\[\\displaystyle\n31=21+(33-21)e^{-k}\\] Using this equation, we can solve for \\emph{k}:\n\n\\begin{align*}\ne^{-k} & =\\frac{31-21}{33-21}=\\frac{5}{6} \\\\\n-k & =\\ln(5/6) \\\\\nk & =-\\ln(5/6) \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\nAnd so now we have found the equation that gives us the temperature of\nthe body at any time \\emph{t}:\n\n\\[\\displaystyle\nT(t) = 21 + 12e^{t\\ln(5/6)}\\] and we would like to know the time of\ndeath, which is the time at which the body temperature was\n37$^{\\circ}$C. For this, we simply solve\n\n\\[\\displaystyle\nT(t) = 37\\] that is\n\n\\begin{align*}\n21 + 12e^{t\\ln(5/6)} &= 37 \\\\\n12e^{t\\ln(5/6)} &= 16 \\\\\ne^{t\\ln(5/6)} &= 16/12 \\\\\nt\\ln(5/6) &= \\ln(4/3) \\\\\nt &= \\frac{\\ln(4/3)}{\\ln(5/6)} \\\\\nt &\\approx -1.578\n\\end{align*}\n\nTherefore, the police arrived (ln(3/4))/(ln(5/6)) hours after the\nmurder, that is, roughly an hour and a half."
