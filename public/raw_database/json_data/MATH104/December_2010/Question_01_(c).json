        "Using the discrete compound interest formula with 4 compounds per year,\nwe know that\n\n\\begin{align*}\\displaystyle \\$12000=\\$10000(1+0.12/4)^{4t},\\end{align*}\n\nwhere \\emph{t} is the time in years required for the \\$10 000 investment\nto grow to \\$12 000. We want to solve for \\emph{t}. Dividing both sides\nby \\$10000,\n\n\\begin{align*}\\displaystyle 1.2=(1+0.03)^{4t}.\\end{align*}\n\nTaking the logarithm of both sides and simplifying,\n\n\\begin{align*}\\ln(1.2)= \\ln\\left(1.03^{4t}\\right) = 4t \\ln\\left(1.03\\right)\\end{align*}\n\nHence, the investment will take\n\n\\begin{align*}t= \\frac{\\ln(1.2)}{4\\ln(1.03)}\\end{align*}\n\nyears to grow to \\$12000.\n\n''A calculator would tell you that \\emph{t} is about 1.54 years.''"
