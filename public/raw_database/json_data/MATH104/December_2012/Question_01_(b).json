To check that the limit at $x = 1$ exists, we do not need to bother\nwith left and right-hand limits as the function is defined in the same\nway on both sides of $x = 1$.\n\n\\begin{align*}\n\\lim_{x \\rightarrow 1}\\frac{x\\exp(x) - \\exp(x)}{x^{2} - 3x + 2} &= \\lim_{x \\rightarrow 1}\\frac{(x - 1)\\exp(x)}{(x - 1)(x - 2)} \\\\\n&= \\lim_{x \\rightarrow 1}\\frac{\\exp(x)}{(x - 2)} = -\\exp(1) = -e\n\\end{align*}\n\nSo we have $\\lim_{x \\rightarrow 1}f(x)$ exists and is equal to $-e$.\n\niii. The last condition to check is\n\n\\begin{align*}\n\\lim_{x \\rightarrow 1}f(x) &= f(1) \\quad \\rightarrow \\quad -e = a\n\\end{align*}\n\nSo we can see that for the last condition of continuity to be satisfied\nwe must have $a = -e$.\n\nTherefore, ${\\color{blue}\\displaystyle a =-e}$."
