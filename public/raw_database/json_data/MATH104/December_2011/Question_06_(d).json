    "statement": "In this problem, you will approximate $\\ln(0.9)$ in two ways: one using\nlinear approximation and the other using quadratic approximation. You\nmay find it useful to draw the graph of $\\ln(x)$ for $x$ near 1 to help\nyou answer some parts of this question.\n\nd) Use the quadratic approximation (second-degree Taylor polynomial) to\n$f(x) = \\ln(x)$ centred at $a = 1$ to approximate $\\ln(0.9)$.",

        "Beginning with definition of the quadratic approximation of a function\n$f(x)$ at a point $a$, we find that the quadratic approximation to\n$\\ln(x)$ at $a = 1$ is given by:\n\n\\begin{align*}\nQ(x) &= f(a) + f'(a)(x - a) + \\frac1{2}f''(a)(x - a)^{2} \\\\ \n&= \\ln(a) + \\frac{1}{a}(x - 1) + \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{-1}{a^{2}}\\right)(x - 1)^{2} \\\\\n&= \\ln(1) + \\frac{1}{1}(x - 1) + \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{-1}{1^{2}}\\right)(x - 1)^{2}\\\\\n&= 0 + (x - 1) - \\frac{1}{2}(x - 1)^{2}\\end{align*} Thus the quadratic approximation for $\\ln(0.9)$ is:\n\n\\begin{align*}\\ln(0.9) \\approx Q(0.9) = -0.1 - \\frac{0.01}{2} = -0.105\\end{align*}"
