        "As suggested in the hint, this function is continuous everywhere except\nfor possibly at the point $x=2$. There we need to check continuity and\ndifferentiability there. For continuity, we require that the following\nthree quantities are all the same\n\n$\\lim_{x \\to 2^{+}}f(x) = f(2) = \\lim_{x \\to 2^{-}}f(x)$\n\nSince $f(2) = (2)^{2} - 2(2) + 1 = 1$ we have to check that both limits\nabove also equal 1. Calculating the limits we find that\n\n\\begin{align*}\n\\lim_{x \\to 2^{-}}f(x) &= (2)^{2} - 2(2) + 1 = 1 \\\\\n\\lim_{x \\to 2^{+}}f(x) &= a(2) + b = 2a + b\\end{align*}\n\nThus we require $2a + b = 1$. Rearranging this, we see that $b-1 = -2a.$\nThe second piece of information come from checking that the function is\ndifferentiable. For differentiability, we require that the following two\nlimits are the same\n\n\\begin{align*}\\lim_{x \\to 2^{+}}\\frac{f(x)-f(2)}{x-2} = \\lim_{x \\to 2^{-}}\\frac{f(x)-f(2)}{x-2}\\end{align*}\n\nCalculating these limits we find\n\n\\begin{align*}\n\\lim_{x \\to 2^{+}}\\frac{f(x)-f(2)}{x-2} &= \\lim_{x \\to 2^{+}}\\frac{x^{2}-2x+1-1}{x-2}\\\\\n&= \\lim_{x \\to 2^{+}}\\frac{x(x-2)}{x-2}\\\\\n&= \\lim_{x \\to 2^{+}}x\\\\\n&= 2\\end{align*} and using $b-1=-2a$ from above we find that the\nleft-handed limit is\n\n\\begin{align*}\n\\lim_{x \\to 2^{-}}\\frac{f(x)-f(2)}{x-2} &= \\lim_{x \\to 2^{-}}\\frac{ax+b-1}{x-2}\\\\\n&= \\lim_{x \\to 2^{-}}\\frac{ax+(-2a)}{x-2}\\\\\n&= a\\lim_{x \\to 2^{-}}\\frac{x-2}{x-2}\\\\\n&= a\\lim_{x \\to 2^{-}}1\\\\\n&= a\\end{align*}\n\nFor the previous two limits to be equal we require that\n$\\displaystyle a=2$. Substituting back into $2a + b = 1$ shows us that\n$b = -3$.\n\n\\emph{Note.} We could also have taken a bit of a short cut and seen that\nthis function is differentiable if the derivatives of the two halves are\nequal at 2, that is $\\frac{d}{dx}(x^{2} - 2x + 1) = 2x-2$ at $x=2$ has\nto equal $\\frac{d}{dx}(ax+b) = a$."

        "Each branch of the function is differentiable (why?). Therefore, the\nonly point where our function might not be differentiable is at the\nbreak point of the function (in this case, at $x=2$).", 
        "In order for a function to be differentiable at 2, it must also be\ncontinuous at 2. Use\n\\href{Science:Math_Exam_Resources/Courses/MATH110/December_2013/Question_10_(a)}{part\n(a)} and the fact that we want continuity to help find these values."
