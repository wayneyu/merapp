        "To find the general solution for this problem, we need to find both the\nparticular solution, $y_{p}$, and homogeneous solution, $y_{h}$.\n\nThe homogeneous solution satisfies\n\n\\begin{align*}\\displaystyle{}y_{h}'' + 2y_{h}' + y_{h} = 0,\\end{align*}\n\nwhich can be solved using the technique from\n\\href{Science:Math_Exam_Resources/Courses/MATH101/April_2005/Question_1_(d)}{part\n(d)} of this exam to obtain the solution\n\n\\begin{align*}\\displaystyle\ny_{h}(x) = c_{1}e^{-x} + c_{2}xe^{-x}.\\end{align*}\n\nTo find the particular solution, we look at the right hand side of the\nequation and notice that there is a term that is linear in $x$ (as\nopposed to quadratic, cubic, etc.). So we can assume a trial solution of\n$y_p = ax + b$ and plug this into the differential equation to find the\nconstants $a,b$ such that the original differential equation is\nsatisfied.\n\n\\begin{align*}\ny_{p}'' + 2y_{p}' + y_{p} &= x \\\\\n0 + 2a + ax + b &= x\\end{align*}\n\nBy comparing the linear and constant terms on both sides of the\nequation, we can see that for the differential equation to be satisfied,\nwe must satisfy $a = 1$ and $2a + b = 0$. Thus, $a = 1$, $b = 2$. So the\ngeneral solution to the differential equation is the sum of the\nhomogeneous and particular solutions:\n\n\\begin{align*}\\displaystyle\ny(x) = x + 2 + c_{1}e^{-x} + c_{2}xe^{-x}\\end{align*}\n\nwhere $c_{1},\\,c_{2}$ are arbitrary constants."
