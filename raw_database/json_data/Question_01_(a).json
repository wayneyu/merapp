        "When we evaluate the function at $t=-2$ we obtain 0/0. Since this is a\nrational function, it means that we can factor $t+2$ in each of the\ndenominator and numerator:\n\n\\[\\displaystyle\n2t^2+t-6 = (t+2)(2t-3)\\] and\n\n\\[\\displaystyle\nt^2-4 = (t+2)(t-2)\\] Hence\n\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\lim_{t \\to -2}\\frac{2t^2+t-6}{t^2-4} &= \\lim_{t \\to -2}\\frac{(t+2)(2t-3)}{(t+2)(t-2)}\\\\\n&= \\lim_{t \\to -2}\\frac{(2t-3)}{(t-2)}\\\\\n= \\frac{2(-2)-3}{(-2)-2}\\\\\n= \\frac{7}{4}\n\\end{align}\\]"

        "What happens if you simply plug in -2 in the function? What does it\nmean? What can you do about that?", 
        "Evaluating at -2 gives 0/0 which is undefined. This means we just don't\nknow anything about what the limit might be (it could be anything). So\nwe need to deal with that. Notice that the function is a rational\nfunction (a fraction with polynomials in both numerator and\ndenominator), since each are 0 at \\emph{t}=-2, it means that -2 is a\nroot of each and hence, they can be factorized."
