    "statement": "Choose ONE of the next two problems (C.5.1 or C.5.2).\n\nA hot air balloon with a basket hanging below it is released from the\nground and rises straight up at a speed of 5 meters per second. At the\nmoment the balloon is released, a girl is 29 meters from the point on\nthe ground directly below the balloon and is riding her bicycle toward\nthe balloon at a speed of 2 meters per second. From the perspective of\nthe girl, at what time \\emph{t} is the angle between the ground and the\nbasket hanging below the balloon changing most quickly?",

        "We will start by drawing a picture relating the different facts given in\nthe problem.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htbp]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=.5\\textwidth]{MER_Math_102_December_2012_Question_C_5_1_Solution.jpg}\n\\caption{ 400px }\n\\end{figure}\n\nNow it is necessary to figure out what the question is asking. This is\nan optimization problem, where the thing being optimized is the rate at\nwhich $\\theta$ is changing, or $d\\theta/dt$. So our next step is to\nactually find an expression for this rate.\n\nWe start by relating all the information we already have in the\nquestion. The diagram shows a right triangle, with adjacent and opposite\nsides labeled. Thus, the best way to relate the information is the\ntangent function.\n\n$\\tan \\theta = h / b$\n\nWe can express the height of the balloon as a function of time. Since it\nis rising at a rate of 5 m/s, the height of the balloon can be given as\n$h(t) = 5t$. Similarly, the distance of the girl from the ballon's\nliftoff point can be given as the initial distance, minus her rate of\ntravel, or $b(t) = 29 - 2t$. Plugging these into the formula, we get:\n\n$\\tan \\theta = \\frac{5t}{29-2t}$\n\nDifferentiating with respect to time (\\emph{t}) gives:\n\n$\\sec ^2 \\theta \\frac{d\\theta}{dt}  = \\frac{5(29-2t)-5t(-2)}{(29-2t)^2}$\n\nWe want our final expression to be in terms of $t$, so we want to change\nthe $\\sec^2\\theta$ into an expression in terms of \\emph{t}. We will do\nthis by going back to the definition of $\\sec\\theta$ as a trig ratio. We\nrecall $\\sec \\theta$ is the ratio of hypotenuse over adjacent, or $c/b$\nin our notation. In particular, we have $\\sec^2 \\theta = c^2/b^2$. The\nadjacent side \\emph{b} is given by $29-2t$ and we can use the\nPythagorean theorem to find the hypotenuse $c^2$.\n\n$c^2 = (5t)^2 + (29-2t)^2$\n\nSo we have\n\n$\\sec^2 \\theta = \\frac{(5t)^2 + (29-2t)^2}{(29-2t)^2}$\n\nReplacing $\\sec^2 \\theta$ in our original equation, we get:\n\n$\\frac{(5t)^2 + (29-2t)^2}{(29-2t)^2}\\frac{d\\theta}{dt} = \\frac{5(29-2t)-5t(-2)}{(29-2t)^2}$\n\nWe want to solve this expression for $d\\theta/dt$. Simplifying the above\nexpression, we get:\n\n$\\frac{d\\theta}{dt} = \\frac{145}{(5t)^2 + (29-2t)^2}$\n\nNow we finally have an expression for $d\\theta/dt$. To complete the\nproblem, we must find where it is at a maximum. To do so, we will use\nour usual method for finding a maximum: differentiating, finding\ncritical points, and testing whether it is a maximum.\n\nTaking the derivative gives with respect to \\emph{t} gives:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{d^2\\theta}{dt^2} &= \\frac{-145(2(5t)(5) +2(29-2t)(-2))}{((5t)^2 + (29-2t)^2)^2}\\\\\n&= \\frac{-145(50t -116 +8t)}{((5t)^2 + (29-2t)^2)^2}\\\\\n&= \\frac{-145(58t -116)}{((5t)^2 + (29-2t)^2)^2}\\\\\n&= \\frac{-145\\cdot 58(t - 2)}{((5t)^2 + (29-2t)^2)^2}\n\\end{align*}\n\nWe are free to ignore the denominator, as it is always positive, thus\nnever makes the derivative undefined. We can therefore restrict our\nattention to the numerator, set it equal to zero, and solve for\n\\emph{t}. This gives $t=2$. It remains to show that this point is a\nmaximum. The easiest way to do this is the first derivative test; that\nis choosing two points on either side of our critical point $t = 2$ and\nchecking if the sign of the derivative changes. Again, the denominator\nof the derivative is always positive, so we need only consider the\nnumerator:\n\n\\begin{longtable}[c]{@{}llll@{}}\n& t \\textless{} 2 & t = 2 & t \\textgreater{} 2\\\\\n$d^2\\theta/dt^2$ & + & 0 & -\\\\\n\\end{longtable}\n\nThis indicates that the original rate $d\\theta/dt$ changes from\nincreasing to decreasing at $t = 2$, meaning that it is indeed the\nmaximum we're looking for. The time at which the angle $\\theta$ is\nincreasing the fastest is at $t =2$ seconds after the balloon is\nreleased."

        "In order to find the expression for $d\\theta/dt$, after differentiating\nan equation containing $\\tan\\theta$, you will need to use the fact that\n$\\sec\\theta$ is equal to the hypotenuse over the side adjacent the\nangle."
