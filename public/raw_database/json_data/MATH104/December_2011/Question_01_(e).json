        "The absolute maximum of \\emph{f} may occur at the critical points (if it\nhas any), or at the endpoints of its domain. We can solve this problem\nby finding the domain of \\emph{f} first, then by finding its critical\npoints.\n\n\\subsection{Determine the Domain of\n$f$}\\label{determine-the-domain-of-ux192}\n\nBecause of the square root, the domain of \\emph{f} is defined where\n$2 - x^2$ is positive or zero. Therefore,\n\n\\begin{align*} 0 \n&\\le 2 - x^2 \\\\\nx^2&\\le 2 \\\\\nx &\\le \\pm \\sqrt{2}\n\\end{align*}\n\nThe domain of the given function is\n\n\\[[-\\sqrt{2},+\\sqrt{2}]\\]\n\n\\subsection{Find the Critical Points of\n$f$}\\label{find-the-critical-points-of-ux192}\n\nThe critical points of $f$ are located where its derivative is zero. Let's\nfind the derivative of $f$:\n\n\\begin{align*} \n\\frac{df}{dx} &= \\frac{d}{dx}\\Big(x\\sqrt{2-x^2}\\Big) \\\\\n&= \\Big(\\frac{d}{dx}(x)\\Big)\\sqrt{2-x^2} + x\\Big(\\frac{d}{dx}(\\sqrt{2-x^2})\\Big) \\\\\n&= \\Big(1\\Big)\\sqrt{2-x^2} + x\\Big(\\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{2-x^2}}\\frac{d}{dx}(2-x^2)\\Big) \\\\\n&= \\sqrt{2-x^2} + x\\Big(\\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{2-x^2}}(-2x)\\Big) \\\\\n&= \\sqrt{2-x^2} - \\frac{2x^2}{2\\sqrt{2-x^2} }\\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\nSetting this to zero and solving for \\emph{x} yields the critical\npoints:\n\n\\begin{align*} \n0 &= \\sqrt{2-x^2} - \\frac{2x^2}{2\\sqrt{2-x^2} }\\\\\n\\frac{2x^2}{2\\sqrt{2-x^2} } &= \\sqrt{2-x^2} \\\\\n2x^2 &= 2(2-x^2)\\\\\n2x^2 &= 4-2x^2\\\\\n4x^2 &= 4 \\\\\nx^2 &= 1 \\\\\nx &= \\pm 1\n\\end{align*} Therefore, there are two critical points at -1 and +1.\n\n\\subsection{Find Absolute Maximum on the\nDomain}\\label{find-absolute-maximum-on-the-domain}\n\nThe absolute maximum could occur at the two critical points, or at the\nendpoints of the domain.\n\n\\begin{align*}\nf(-\\sqrt{2}) &= 0 \\\\\nf(-1) &= -1 \\\\\nf(+1) &= +1 \\\\\nf(+\\sqrt{2}) &= 0\n\\end{align*}\n\nThe absolute maximum occurs at \\emph{x} = +1."
