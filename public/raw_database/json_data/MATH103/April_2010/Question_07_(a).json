        "To get from the cumulative function to the probability density function,\nyou need to take the derivate, i.e.\n\n\\[p(t) = F'(t) = \\frac1{12}e^{-t/12}.\\]\n\nNow we apply the definition of the expected value to the random variable\n\\emph{X} that denotes the waiting time:\n\n\\[\\overline{X} = \\int_0^\\infty tp(t)\\,dt.\\]\n\nThis is an improper integral, so we treat it with caution. To solve it,\nwe apply integration by parts with \\emph{u=t} and \\emph{dv =\ne\\textsuperscript{-t/12}dt} and obtain\n\n\\begin{align*} \\overline{X} &= \\int_0^\\infty tp(t)\\,dt \\\\\n&= \\lim_{T \\rightarrow \\infty} \\left(\\frac1{12} \\int_0^T te^{-t/12}\\,dt\\right) \\\\\n&= \\lim_{T \\rightarrow \\infty} \\left(\\left.\\frac1{12} t(-12e^{-t/12})\\right|_0^T + \\frac1{12} \\int_0^T 12e^{-t/12}\\,dt\\right) \\\\\n&= \\lim_{T \\rightarrow \\infty} \\left(-Te^{-T/12} + 0 - \\left.12e^{-t/12}\\right|_0^T\\right) \\\\\n&= \\lim_{T \\rightarrow \\infty} \\left(-12e^{-T/12} + 12e^0\\right) \\\\\n&= 12;\n\\end{align*}", 
        "From class and the course notes you may remember that waiting time\ntypically has a probability density function and cumulative function of\nthe form\n\n\\[p(t) = ke^{-kt}, \\quad \\text{and} \\quad F(t) = 1-e^{-kt},\\]\n\nrespectively. In this case, the expected waiting time is given by\n\\emph{1/k}. Here \\emph{k = 1/12} so that the expected value is\n\\emph{12}."

        "Recall that the average value of a continuous random variable \\emph{X}\nwith values between \\emph{a} and \\emph{b} and probability density\nfunction \\emph{p(X=x) = p(x)} is defined as\n\n\\[\\int_a^b xp(x)\\,dx\\]", 
        "How can you relate the given cumulative function \\emph{F(t)} to the\nprobability density function \\emph{p(t)}?", 
        "For a quick solution: The given cumulative function is the typical\ncumulative function of a \\emph{waiting time}. The expected waiting time\nis already hidden in the exponential function."
