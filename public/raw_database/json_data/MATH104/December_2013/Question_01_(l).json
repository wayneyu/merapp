        "The answer is (E).\n\nNone of these have to be true! The following is a counter example\n\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item\n  \\begin{itemize}\n  \\itemsep1pt\\parskip0pt\\parsep0pt\n  \\item\n    Insert graph with a limit at L but no value defined there.\n  \\end{itemize}\n\\end{itemize}"

        "Remember that limits only tell you information about the values of the\nfunction \\textbf{near} the value at \\emph{a}. In a vacuum, limits don't\nsay much about the actual value at \\emph{a}."
