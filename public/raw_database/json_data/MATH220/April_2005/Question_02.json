Determine which is\nwhich. For the true one, prove that it is true; for the false one, prove\nthat it is false.",

        "The second statement should appear wrong fairly immediately since it\ntalking about the existence of \\emph{the smallest real number} which\ncannot exist. Let's prove this:\n\n\\begin{description}\n\\itemsep1pt\\parskip0pt\\parsep0pt\n\\item[]\nThe statement says that for \\emph{any} real number \\emph{z} it should be\ntrue that \\emph{y} \\textless{} \\emph{z}, but if I pick \\emph{z} to be\nexactly that mysterious number \\emph{y} I should have \\emph{y}\n\\textless{} \\emph{y} which is clearly impossible, so the statement is\nfalse.\n\\end{description}\n\nNow we can prove that the first statement is true:\n\n\\begin{description}\n\\itemsep1pt\\parskip0pt\\parsep0pt\n\\item[]\nThat statement says that if any real number \\emph{w} is picked, then one\ncan find a real number \\emph{x} that is larger than \\emph{w}. Well, sure\nenough, if one always choses \\emph{x} = \\emph{w} + 1, then clearly it is\nalways going to be larger than the \\emph{w} that was picked in the first\nplace.\n\\end{description}"
