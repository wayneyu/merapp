    "statement": "A bee is flying along the curve of intersection of the surfaces\n$3z + x^{2} + y^{2} = 2$ and $z = x^{2} - y^{2}$ in the direction for\nwhich z is increasing. At time t = 2, the bee passes through the point\n(1,1,0) at speed 6.\n\n(a) Find the velocity (vector) of the bee at time t = 2.",

        "We let the vector $\\mathbf{v}$ be the velocity vector. If the bee\ntravels along a path in $\\mathbb{R}^{3}$ given by\n$[x(t),y(t),z(t)]^{T}$, then $\\mathbf{v}$ is given by\n\n\\[\\mathbf{v} = \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{d}{dt}x(t), \\frac{d}{dt}y(t), \\frac{d}{dt}z(t) \\end{bmatrix}^{T}\\]\nWe are told that the bee is travelling along a path defined by the\nintersection of the two surfaces\\[3z + x^{2} + y^{2} = 2\\] and\n$z = x^{2} - y^{2}$. Therefore, we can differentiate each relationship\nwith respect to t to get a pair of equations describing the velocity of\nthe bee at any point along the curve:\n\n\\[3\\frac{dz}{dt} + 2x\\frac{dx}{dt} + 2y\\frac{dy}{dt} = 0, \\quad \\frac{dz}{dt} = 2x\\frac{dx}{dt} - 2y\\frac{dy}{dt}.\\]\nWe are interested in analyzing the velocity at (1,1,0), so plug this\npoint into the above equations:\n\n\\[3\\frac{dz}{dt} + 2\\frac{dx}{dt} + 2\\frac{dy}{dt} = 0, \\quad \\frac{dz}{dt} - 2\\frac{dx}{dt} + 2\\frac{dy}{dt} = 0.\\]\nSolving the two equations to get $\\frac{dx}{dt},\\,\\frac{dy}{dt}$ in\nterms of $\\frac{dz}{dt}$ gives:\n\n\\[\\frac{dx}{dt} = -\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{dz}{dt}, \\quad \\frac{dy}{dt} = -\\frac{dz}{dt}\\]\nSo at the point (1,1,0), we can write the velocity vector in terms of\n$z'(t)$:\n\n\\[\\mathbf{v} = \\left(\\frac{d}{dt}z(t)\\right)\\begin{bmatrix} -\\frac{1}{2}, -1, 1 \\end{bmatrix}^{T}.\\]\nWe know that the speed of the bee is 6 at the point (1,1,0), so we use\nthe equation\n\n\\[|\\mathbf{v}| =\\left(\\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{d}{dt}z(t)\\right)^{2}}\\right)\\left(\\sqrt{\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{2} + \\left(-1\\right)^{2} + \\left(1\\right)^{2}}\\right) = 6\\]\nSolving for $\\frac{dz}{dt}$ gives\n\n\\[\\left(\\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{d}{dt}z(t)\\right)^{2}}\\right) = \\frac{6}{\\sqrt{9/4}} = 4 \\quad \\rightarrow \\quad \\frac{d}{dt}z(t) = \\pm 4.\\]\nTaking the positive solution, (since the bee is travelling in the\ndirection of increasing z, we can write the velocity vector\n\n\\[{\\color{blue}\n\\mathbf{v} = \\begin{bmatrix} -2, -4, 4 \\end{bmatrix}^{T}}\\]"
