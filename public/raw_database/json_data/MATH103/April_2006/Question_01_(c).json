    "statement": "A calcium channel in a cardiac muscle cell opens and closes in a random\nmanner. Before receiving a signal for contraction, the channel is\nclosed. The channel opens \\emph{t} milliseconds after the signal is\nreceived where \\emph{t} has a probability density given by\n$\\displaystyle p(t) = \\frac{1}{50}e^{-t/50}$ for\n$\\displaystyle 0 < t < \\infty$. Which of the following gives the\nexpected time at which the channel opens?\n\ni. $\\displaystyle \\frac{1}{50}\\int_{0}^{\\infty}e^{-t/50}\\,dt$\n\nii. $\\displaystyle \\frac{1}{50}\\int_{0}^{\\infty}te^{-t/50}\\,dt$\n\niii. $\\displaystyle \\frac{1}{50}\\int_{0}^{\\infty}t^{2}e^{-t/50}\\,dt$\n\niv. $\\displaystyle \\frac{1}{50}\\int_{0}^{\\infty}(t-50)^{2}e^{-t/50}\\,dt$",
