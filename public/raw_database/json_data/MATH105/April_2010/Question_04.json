    "statement": "The production function for a firm is\n\n\\[\\displaystyle\nf(x,y) = 5x^{2/3}y^{1/3},\\] where $x$ and $y$ are the number of units of\nlabour and capital utilized respectively. Suppose that labour costs\n\\$108 per unit and capital costs \\$2 per unit and that the firm decides\nto produce 600 units of goods. Use Lagrange multipliers to determine the\namounts of labour and capital that should be utilized in order to\nminimize cost. You need not show that your solution minimizes the cost.",

        "We are given that labour costs \\$108 per unit and capital costs \\$2 per\nunit, and we want to minimize cost. Thus the objective function is\n\n\\[\\displaystyle C(x, y) = 108x + 2y.\\] The firm wants to produce 600\nunits, so using the production function we want\n$\\displaystyle 5x^{2/3}y^{1/3} = 600$. Thus the constraint function is\n\n\\[\\displaystyle g(x, y) = x^{2/3}y^{1/3} - 120,\\] and the constraint is\ng(x, y) = 0.\n\nThe Lagrange multiplier method says that the gradients of the objective\nfunction and the constraint function should be proportional, or\n\n\\[\\nabla C(x, y) = \\lambda \\nabla g(x, y).\\] The gradient of the\nobjective function is\n\n\\[\\nabla C(x, y) = \\langle 108, 2 \\rangle.\\] and the gradient of the\nconstraint function is\n\n\\[\\nabla g(x, y) = \\langle \\frac{2}{3}x^{-1/3}y^{1/3}, \\frac{1}{3}x^{2/3}y^{-2/3}\\rangle\\]\nThen we have three equations that must be satisfied\n\n\\[108 = \\lambda\\frac{2}{3}x^{-1/3}y^{1/3},\\]\n\n\\[2 = \\lambda\\frac{1}{3}x^{2/3}y^{-2/3},\\]\n\n\\[\\displaystyle x^{2/3}y^{1/3} - 120 = 0.\\]\n\nSolving the second equation for $\\lambda$ gives\n\n\\[\\lambda = 6x^{-2/3}y^{2/3},\\] and substituting into the first equation\nto eliminate $\\lambda$ gives\n\n\\[108 = 6x^{-2/3}y^{2/3}\\frac{2}{3}x^{-1/3}y^{1/3}.\\] Simplifying, we\nhave\n\n\\[\\displaystyle 108 = 4x^{-1}y,\\] and then we solve for y to get\n\n\\[\\displaystyle y = 27x.\\] Now substituting into the third equation, the\nconstraint equation, gives\n\n\\[\\displaystyle x^{2/3}(27x)^{1/3} - 120 = 0.\\] Simplifying, we have\n\n\\[\\displaystyle 3x = 120,\\] and thus\n\n\\[\\displaystyle x = 40.\\] We then have that\n\n\\[\\displaystyle{}y=27x=27(40)=1080.\\]\n\nTherefore the cost is minimized when using 40 units of labour and 1080\nunits of capital."
