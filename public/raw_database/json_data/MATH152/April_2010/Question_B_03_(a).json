        "If the walker starts in state 1, then the probability vector is given by\n\n$\\mathbf{v} = \\left[ \\begin{array}{c} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{array} \\right]$\n\n(i.e: the walker is in state 1 with probability 1 and in state 2 with\nprobability 0). To compute the probability that the walker is in state 2\nafter one step, simply compute $P$v and look at the second entry:\n\n$P\\mathbf{v} = \\left[ \\begin{array}{c} 1/3 \\\\ 2/3 \\end{array} \\right]$\n\nThus, the probability of switching from state 1 to state 2 in one time\nstep is 2/3.\n\n(Equivalently, to answer this question you could look at the second\nentry in the first column of the matrix $P$)."
