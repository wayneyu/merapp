        "Let us begin by assuming that the cycle only repeats over a single\nvalue. It should be immediately obvious that the only possible value\nthat this could be is 0 since if the initial values were less than 0,\nthe values will become increasingly negative and if the initial values\nwere greater than 0, the values will become increasingly positive. Since\nwe want a non-zero periodic sequence, a cycle of 1 value is not\npossible. Therefore, we will look at a cycle which repeats over 2\nvalues. This implies:\n\n\\begin{align*}\nx_{2} &= x_{0}\\\\\nx_{3} &= x_{1}\\\\\n&\\vdots\\\\\nx_{n} &= x_{n-2}\\end{align*}\n\nIf we just take the first value that can use the recursion relation\n($x_{3}$), we see that we can arrive at the following through basic\nalgebra (where in step two we use that $x_{3} = x_{1}$ :\n\n\\begin{align*}\n&x_{3} = 2x_{1} + x_{0}\\\\\n&x_{1} = 2x_{1} + x_{0}\\\\\n&x_{1} + x_{0} = 0\\\\\n&x_{1} = -x_{0} = -x_{2}\\end{align*}\n\nWe just showed that a recursive cycle of 2 values is possible! If we\nassign the first two values to be the negative of each other, we will\nhave a repeating cycle of the two selected values. Therefore, the\nfollowing are all possible choices for the initial three values\n(remember that we need three initial values!):\n\n$\\begin{bmatrix}\nx_{0}\\\\\nx_{1}\\\\\nx_{2}\n\\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix}\n1 \\\\\n-1 \\\\\n1 \n\\end{bmatrix}, \\begin{bmatrix}\n-1 \\\\\n1 \\\\\n-1 \n\\end{bmatrix}, \\begin{bmatrix}\n2 \\\\\n-2 \\\\\n2 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}, \\begin{bmatrix}\n-\\pi \\\\\n\\pi \\\\\n-\\pi \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}, etc.$"
