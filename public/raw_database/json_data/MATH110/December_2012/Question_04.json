        "As suggested by the hint, we will solve for zero on one side of the\nequation, giving:\n\n$-x^3 + x^2 + 2x - \\ln(x) - 1 = 0$\n\nWe now need to show that there is a number \\emph{c} in the interval\n\\emph{(1,2)} that makes the left side equal to zero. This should remind\nyou of the Intermediate Value Theorem (IVT). The statement of the IVT\nsays\n\n\\begin{description}\n\\itemsep1pt\\parskip0pt\\parsep0pt\n\\item[]\nIf f(x) is continuous on {[}a,b{]} and for some number L, f(a)\n\\textless{} L \\textless{} f(b), then there exists c in (a,b) such that\nf(c) = L.\" In our scenario, the left side of the equation is\n\\emph{f(x)}, \\emph{a = 1}, \\emph{b=2}, and ''L = 0'.\n\\end{description}\n\nIn order to use the IVT, we need to check that the function is\ncontinuous on the interval \\emph{{[}1,2{]}}. As each term of the\nfunction is continuous on the interval, the whole function is also\ncontinuous on the interval.\n\nNow we compute \\emph{f(1)} and \\emph{f(2)}.\n\n$f(1) = -1 + 1 + 2 -\\ln(1) -1 = 1 > 0$\n\n$f(2) = -8 + 4 + 4 - \\ln(2) - 1 < 0$\n\nBecause \\emph{f(1) \\textless{} 0 \\textless{} f(2)}, we can now use the\nIVT to conclude that there exists a number \\emph{c} in the interval\n\\emph{(1,2)} such that \\emph{f(c) = 0}."
