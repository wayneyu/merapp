        "Clearly $\\displaystyle 0^{6} \\equiv 0 \\mod{31}$ and\n$\\displaystyle (\\pm 1)^{6} \\equiv 1 \\mod{31}$ so throughout we suppose\nthat both \\emph{x} is greater than 1 but less than 30. This leaves 28\nsuch values left to be computed. We begin by computing at powers of two.\nSince\n\n$\\displaystyle (\\pm 2)^{6} \\equiv (\\pm1)^{6}\\cdot 2^{5}\\cdot2 \\equiv 2 \\mod{31}$\n\nwe see that \\emph{a} equals 2 is an admissable value. Further, we\nimmediately get that\n\n$\\displaystyle (2^{b})^{6} \\equiv (2^{6})^{b} \\equiv 2^{b} \\mod{31}$\n\nand so for \\emph{b} ranging from 1 to 4 we see that \\emph{a} can take on\nthe values 2,4,8 or 16. This covers the \\emph{x} values\n$\\displaystyle x=\\pm 2,\\pm 4,\\pm 8,\\pm 16$.\n\nNext for \\emph{x} equals $\\pm 3$, notice that\n\n$\\displaystyle (\\pm 3)^{6} \\equiv (3^{3})^{2} \\equiv (27)^{2} \\equiv (-4)^{2} \\equiv 16 \\mod{31}$\n\nwhich gives us an already chosen \\emph{a} value. Using these facts, we\ncan clearly see that\n\nFurther at \\emph{x} equals $\\pm 5$,\n\n$\\displaystyle (\\pm 5)^{6} \\equiv (5^{2})^{3} \\equiv (-6)^{3} \\equiv -6\\cdot 36 \\equiv -6\\cdot 5 \\equiv 1$\n\nand this value was also an already chosen \\emph{a} value. I claim that\nthese values are enough to show that all admissable values of \\emph{a}\nhave already been found. To see this, notice for example that\n\n$\\displaystyle (\\pm 6)^{6} \\equiv 3^{6}\\cdot2^{6} \\mod{31}$\n\nand the right hand side was already shown to be a power of 2. Similarly\n\n$\\displaystyle (\\pm 7)^{6} \\equiv (\\pm 1)^{6}(7)^{6} \\equiv (-7)^{6} \\equiv (24)^{6} \\equiv (2^{3})^{6}\\cdot3^{6} \\mod{31}$\n\nis also a power of 2. Crunching through the remaining cases, we have\n\n$\\displaystyle (\\pm 9)^{6} \\equiv (3^{6})^{2}\\mod{31}$\n\n$\\displaystyle (\\pm 10)^{6} \\equiv 2^{6}\\cdot 5^{6}\\mod{31}$\n\n$\\displaystyle (\\pm 11)^{6} \\equiv (\\pm 1)^{6}(11)^{6} \\equiv (-11)^{6} \\equiv 20^{6}\\mod{31}$\n\n$\\displaystyle (\\pm 12)^{6} \\equiv 4^{6}\\cdot 3^{6}\\mod{31}$\n\n$\\displaystyle (\\pm 13)^{6} \\equiv (\\pm 1)^{6}(13)^{6} \\equiv (-13)^{6} \\equiv (18)^{6} \\equiv \\equiv 2^{6}\\cdot 9^{6}\\mod{31}$\n\n$\\displaystyle (\\pm 14)^{6} \\equiv 2^{6}\\cdot 7^{6}\\mod{31}$\n\nand in all these cases, we have already shown the right hand side to be\na power of 2. Thus the admissable values for \\emph{a} are given by\n$\\displaystyle a \\in \\{0,1,2,4,8,16\\}$."

        "The general strategy for this problem will be to evaluate the value of\n$\\displaystyle x^{6}$ at all integers between 0 and 30 inclusive.", 
        "Notice that $\\displaystyle 31 = 32-1 = 2^{5}-1$ so evaluating\n$\\displaystyle x^{6}$ at powers of two should be fairly straight\nforward.", 
        "For other values of \\emph{x}, try to swap between \\emph{x} and its\nnegation to help with the computations. You don't need to compute a lot\nof values by hand before you can quickly do all 31 values.", 
        "Compute it for some small values of primes then use this information\nalong with hint 2 to immediately calculate this for all such values."
