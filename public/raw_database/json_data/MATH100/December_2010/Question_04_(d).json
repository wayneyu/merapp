        "To determine the intervals of concavity, we must evaluate $f''(x)$\nand determine where it is positive and negative:\n\n\\begin{align*}f(x) = \\begin{cases}\n\\frac{4}{\\pi}\\tan^{-1}(x) & \\text{if } x \\geq 1 \\\\\n2 - x^{4} & \\text{if } x < 1 \n\\end{cases}\\end{align*} Evaluating the second derivative of f gives\n\n\\begin{align*}f''(x) = \\begin{cases}\n\\frac{4}{\\pi}\\frac{-2x}{(1 + x^{2})^{2}} & \\text{if } x > 1 \\\\\n-12x^{2} & \\text{if } x < 1 \n\\end{cases}\\end{align*} From this we see that the possible inflection points are\n\\emph{x} = 0. We need only confirm that the sign of the concavity\nchanges across \\emph{x} = 0. We must also consider concavity changes\nacross \\emph{x} = 1 since $f$ is not differentiable there.\n\nWhen \\emph{x} \\textless{} 1, the second derivative is always negative\nsince -12\\emph{x}\\textsuperscript{2} is always negative.\n\nWhen \\emph{x} \\textgreater{} 1, the second derivative is always negative\nas well since in that case, -2\\emph{x} is always negative.\n\nFrom these results we can see that $f(x)$ is concave down for all\n\\emph{x} except at the critical points. In other words, $f(x)$ is\nconcave down on $(-\\infty,0),(0,1),(1,\\infty)$ and so, there are no\ninflection points."
