        "We will need the following formulas:\n\nThe volume of the box is given by\n\n\\[\\displaystyle V = l w h\\] Where \\emph{l} is the length of the base of\nthe box, \\emph{w} is the width, and \\emph{h} is the height.\n\nThe material will form the outside of the box, which is the same as its\nsurface area. The surface area of an open box is given by\n\n\\[\\displaystyle SA = 2lh + 2wh + lw\\] With \\emph{l}, \\emph{w}, and\n\\emph{h} as before.\n\nWe also know that the length of the base of the box is twice its width.\nIn an equation, this means\n\n\\[\\displaystyle l = 2w\\]\n\nWe can plug this into our volume and surface area formulas to get\n\n\\[\\displaystyle V = 2w^2h\\]\n\n\\[\\displaystyle SA = 6wh +2w^2\\]\n\nWe know one more fact. Because we have $24 m^2$ of material, the formula\nfor surface area must be equal to 24, or\n\n\\[\\displaystyle 24 = 6wh +2w^2\\]\n\nIsolating for \\emph{h} yields\n\n\\[\\displaystyle h = \\frac{24-2w^{2}}{6w}\\]\n\n(NOTE: In this step we are assuming that the width is not equal to zero,\nwhich makes sense given the physical limitations of our problem, that\nis, boxes have positive dimensions). Plugging this into our formula for\nvolume yields\n\n\\[\\displaystyle V = 2w^2h = 2w^{2} \\cdot \\frac{24-2w^{2}}{6w} = \\frac{w(24-2w^{2})}{3} = 8w - \\frac{2}{3}w^{3}\\]\n\nWe wish to optimize \\emph{V}. Now that is has only one variable,\ndifferentiating yields\n\n\\[\\displaystyle V' = 8 - 2w^{2}\\]\n\nSetting this equal to 0 and solving gives $w^{2} = 4$ and thus that\n$w=2$ (where we note again that dimensions must be positive). Looking at\nthe derivative of volume, a sign chart tells us that$V'(w) > 0$ when\n$w < 2$ and $V'(w) > 0$ when $w < 2$. Hence, we have a maximum at\n\\emph{w}=2. The volume of the box with this width is\n\n\\[\\displaystyle V(2) = 8(2) - \\frac{2}{3}(2)^{3} = 16 - \\frac{16}{3} = \\frac{32}{3}\\]\n\nand this is the maximal volume as required."

        "Try drawing a picture. The object we are looking for is a rectangular\nprism with an open top. What is the volume of such an object? What is\nthe surface area?", 
        "Setting \\emph{l} to be the length, \\emph{w} to be the width and \\emph{h}\nto be the height, we have\n\n\\begin{align*}\nV &= lwh \\\\\nSA &= 2lh + 2wh + lw \\\\\nl &= 2w\n\\end{align*}\n\nwhere for the surface area above, we keep in mind that our box has no\ntop.\n\nSince this is an optimization problem, which function are you trying to\nmaximize? Which functions are the constraints?"
