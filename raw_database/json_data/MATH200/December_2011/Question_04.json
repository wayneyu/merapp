        "If the sphere with radius in question $\\displaystyle R$ is enclosed by\nthe ellipse, and the radius is maximal, then the surface of the ellipse\nand the sphere just touch in one point.\n\n\\begin{description}\n\\itemsep1pt\\parskip0pt\\parsep0pt\n\\item[]\n\\includegraphics[width=.5\\textwidth]{Math200Dec11Q4.jpg}\n\\end{description}\n\nThe tangent planes to the surface\n$\\displaystyle 2(x+1)^2 + y^2 + 2(z-1)^2 = 8$ and the sphere with radius\n$\\displaystyle R$ are parallel at the points where the surface and the\nsphere touch. Hence the normal vectors to the tangent planes are also\nparallel.\n\nRegarding the surface equation and the sphere equation as level sets of\nfunctions $f,g:\\mathbb{R}^3\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}$, then the normal\nvectors to these tangent planes are given by the gradients of the\nfunctions $\\displaystyle f$ and $\\displaystyle g$.\n\nThe sphere equation with the origin as center and radius\n$\\displaystyle R$ is $\\displaystyle x^2+y^2+z^2 = R^2$. Then\n$\\displaystyle f(x,y,z) =  2(x+1)^2 + y^2 + 2(z-1)^2$ and\n$\\displaystyle g(x,y,z) =  x^2+y^2+z^2$.

Since we are searching for the radius $\\displaystyle R$ such that\nthe sqhere is enclosed in the ellipse, we need the point\n$\\displaystyle p_i$ with the shortest distance to the origin.\n\n\\begin{align*}\n ||p_1|| &= \\sqrt{12}\\\\\n ||p_2|| &= \\sqrt{12}\\\\\n ||p_3|| & = \\sqrt{6-4\\sqrt{2}}\\\\\n ||p_4|| &= \\sqrt{6+4\\sqrt{2}}\n\\end{align*}\n\nSince $\\displaystyle \\sqrt{6-4\\sqrt{2}}$ is the smallest of these\nnumbers, this is the radius $\\displaystyle R$ of the sqhere."
