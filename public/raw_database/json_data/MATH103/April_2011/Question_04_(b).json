        "\\textbf{Disc Method.} In this solution, we consider the volume as a sum\nof slices, cut orthogonal to the $y$-axis. Each slice has volume\n$\\pi r^2 \\Delta y$, where $r$ is its radius and $\\Delta y$ is its\nthickness. The bowl will be made by rotating the shaded blue region in\nthe 2D figure \\includegraphics[width=.5\\textwidth]{Math103Apr11Q4b-2dgraph.png}. If the\nslice is at height $y$, then its radius is equal to $x$, where $y=e^x$.\nHence, $r=\\ln y.$ In the limit $\\Delta y\\to 0,$\n\n\\begin{align*}\nV_2= \\int_1^e \\pi (\\ln y)^2 \\, dy\n\\end{align*}\n\nNote that the limits of integration are $f(0)=e^0=1$ and $f(1)=e^1=e,$\nsince $x$ ranges from 0 to 1.\n\nWe use integration by parts to evaluate this integral, letting\n$f(y)=g(y)=\\ln y.$ So in order to perform the integration by parts we\nneed to recall the antiderivative of $\\ln y$. To calculate this\nantiderivative we again use integration by parts:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n\\int \\ln y dy &= \\int 1\\cdot \\ln y\\, dy = y\\ln y - \\int y \\cdot \\frac{1}{y} \\, dy \\\\\n&= y\\ln y -  \\int 1 \\, dy= y\\ln y -  y +C.\n\\end{align*}\n\nWe now use this antiderivative to perform the integration by parts in\nthe integral for $V_2.$ Hence,\n\n\\begin{align*}\nV_2&=\\pi \\int_1^e  (\\ln y)^2 \\, dy \\\\\n&= \\pi \\left[ \\ln y (y\\ln y -  y)\\right]_1^e - \\pi\\int _1^e \\frac{1}{y}(y\\ln y -  y) \\, dy\\\\\n&= \\pi \\left[ 1 (e\\cdot 1 -  e) - 0\\right] - \\pi\\int _1^e (\\ln y -  1) \\, dy\\\\\n&= - \\pi\\left[y\\ln y-y -  y\\right]_1^e \\\\\n&= - \\pi\\left[e\\ln e-e-e - 1\\ln 1+1+1\\right] \\\\\n&= - \\pi\\left( - e +2\\right) \\\\\n&= \\pi\\left(  e-2 \\right). \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\n\\emph{Reality check:} Note that we obtain the same value for $V_2$ with\nboth methods. To visualize the full bowl we can look at the 3D figure\n\\includegraphics[width=.5\\textwidth]{Math103Apr11Q4b-3dgraph.png}.", 
        "\\textbf{Shell method.} In this solution, we consider the solid to be a\nsum of cylindrical shells. Each cylindrical shell has volume\n$2\\pi r(x) h(x) \\Delta r,$ where $r(x)$ is its radius, $h(x)$ is its\nheight and $\\Delta r$ is its thickness. The bowl will be made up by\nrotating the blue shaded region in the 2D figure\n\\includegraphics[width=.5\\textwidth]{Math103Apr11Q4b-2dgraph.png}. From there we have\n$r(x)=x$, $h(x)=f(1)-f(x) = e-e^x,$ and $\\Delta r =\\Delta x$. In the\nlimit $\\Delta x \\to 0,$ we obtain the volume by integrating along the\n\\emph{x}-axis:\n\n\\begin{align*}\nV_2 &= \\int_0^1 2\\pi r(x)h(x) \\, dx \\\\\n&= \\int_0^1 2\\pi x (e-e^x) \\, dx\\\\\n&= 2\\pi e \\int_0^1  x\\, dx -2\\pi \\int_0^1 x e^x \\, dx\\\\\n&= 2\\pi  e \\left[\\frac{x^2}{2}\\right]_0^1 -2\\pi \\left(\\left[x e^x\\right]_0^1-\\int_0^1 e^x \\, dx\\right)\\\\\n&= 2\\pi  e \\frac{1}{2} -2\\pi \\left( e- \\left[e^x\\right]_0^1 \\right)\\\\\n&= \\pi  e  -2\\pi \\left( e- (e-1) \\right)\\\\\n&= \\pi  e  -2\\pi \\\\\n&= \\pi  (e  -2).\n\\end{align*}\n\n(We used integration by parts in the second integral to get from the\nthird to the fourth line.)\n\n\\emph{Reality check:} Note that we obtain the same value for $V_2$ with\nboth methods.
