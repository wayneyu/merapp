        "To draw a qualitatively accurate sketch of the derivative of the\nfunction (i.e\\[f'(x)\\]), we need to observe some qualitative features of\nthe slope:\n\n(1) We notice that the slope of the function is zero (i.e: function has\na horizontal tangent line) at $x = -1$ and $x = 1$. (i.e\\[f'(x) = 0\\] at\n$x = -1$ and $x = 1$)\n\n(2) We notice the function has positive slope on $(-1,1)$\n(i.e\\[f'(x) > 0\\] on $(-1,1)$)\n\n(3) We notice the function has negative slope on $(-3,-1)\\cup (1,3)$\n(i.e\\[f'(x) < 0\\] on $(-3,-1)\\cup (1,3)$).\n\nSo we need to sketch a curve for $f'(x)$ that the properties described\nin points (1)-(3). Such a curve is plotted in black below.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htbp]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=.5\\textwidth]{MATH102_2011_2c_sol.png}\n\\caption{MATH102 2011 2c sol.png}\n\\end{figure}"
