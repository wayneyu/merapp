Therefore\n\n\\[\\int_1^\\infty \\frac{e^{-x}}{2x-1}\\,dx \\leq \\int_1^\\infty e^{-x}\\,dx\\]\n\nby the integral comparison test. Since the latter integral\n\n\\[\\int_1^\\infty e^{-x}\\,dx\\] converges (see lecture notes or direct\ncalculation), the former integral also converges, by the integral\ncomparison test."
