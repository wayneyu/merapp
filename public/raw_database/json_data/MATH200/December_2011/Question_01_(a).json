        "The level curves of $f(x,y)$ satisfy $f(x,y) = C$ for arbitrary values\nof $C$ such that a solution to $f(x,y) = C$ exists. Starting with that\nequation we have\n\n\\[\\displaystyle\ne^{-x^2 + 4y^2} = C.\\] We notice that we can take the natural logarithm\nof both sides giving us\n\n\\[\\displaystyle\n-x^2 + 4y^2 = \\ln(C),\\] where $\\ln(C)$ is just an arbitrary constant as\nwell! In other words, the level curves of $e^{-x^2 + 4y^2}$ look the\nsame as those of $-x^2 + 4y^2 = g(x,y)$. The only difference between the\nlevel curves in each situation is the values of $C$ corresponding to\neach specific curve. The level curves of $g(x,y)$ are hyperbolae.\n\nIf we choose five different values of\n$C$\\[C = e^{-2}, e^{-1}, 1, e^{1}, e^{2}\\] and draw the resulting level\ncurves, we get the figure below. (Hint: If you begin drawing the level\ncurves starting with $C = 1$, the remaining curves should be easier to\ndraw)\n\n\\begin{figure}[htbp]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=.5\\textwidth]{MATH200_Dec2011_Q1a_figure.png}\n\\caption{Some level curves of f(x,y)}\n\\end{figure}"
