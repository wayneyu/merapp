        "We have 2 equations in 3 unknowns so the original matrix is\n$2\\times{3}$. Such a system always has infinitely many solutions and\nhence at least one free variable. Denote the components of the solution\nvector \\textbf{x} as $x_1$, $x_2$, and $x_3$. The solution we are given\nsuggests \\emph{x\\textsubscript{3} = t} as the free variable. Further\n\n\\begin{align*}\nx_1&=1+t\\\\\nx_2&=2\\\\\nx_3&=t\n\\end{align*}\n\nTherefore $x_1=1+x_3$ or $x_1-x_3=1$. This means we can write our\naugmented matrix as\n\n\\[\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc|c}\n1  &  0  &  -1  &  1\\\\\n0  &  1  &  0  &  2\n\\end{array}\\right]\\]"
