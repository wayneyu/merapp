The stochastic matrix describing\nthe behaviour of a web surfer (with damping factor zero) is\n\n\\[P = \\begin{bmatrix}\n0 & 0 & \\frac13 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n\\frac12 & 0 & \\frac13 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & \\frac13 & 0 & 0 & 0 & \\frac12 \\\\\n\\frac12 & \\frac13 & 0 & 0 & \\frac12 & 0 \\\\\n0 & \\frac13 & 0 & 1 & 0 & \\frac12 \\\\\n0 & 0 & \\frac13 & 0 & \\frac12 & 0\n\\end{bmatrix}\\]\n\n\\textbf{(b)} If we begin with equal probabilities of being at each site,\nwhat are the probabilities of being at each site after one step? What is\nthe probability of being at site 6 after two steps?",
