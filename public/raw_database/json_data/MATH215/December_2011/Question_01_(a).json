        "Following the hints we multiply the equation by\n$\\exp\\left(\\int -4\\frac{1}{t} dt\\right) = \\exp(-4 \\ln(t)) = 1/t^4$\nyielding:\n\n\\[\\frac{1}{t^4} y' - \\frac{4}{t^5}y = -\\frac{2}{t^6}\\] where we can\nrecognize the left-hand side as the derivative of a single term:\n\n\\[\\left( \\frac{1}{t^4} y\\right)' = -\\frac{2}{t^6}\\]\n\nIntegrating both sides yields\n\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{1}{t^4} y &= \\frac{2}{5t^5} + C \\\\\ny &= \\frac{2}{5t} + Ct^4\n\\end{align*} for an arbitrary constant \\emph{C}.\n\nRemark (not part of solution): Technically\n$\\int \\frac{-4}{t} dt = -4 \\ln(t) + C$ but by multiplying the entire\nequation by the integrating factor, we inevitably divide by it and this\nconstant of integration cancels out."
