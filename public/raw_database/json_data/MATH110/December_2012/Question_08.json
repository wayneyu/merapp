        "Consider a point P=(a,b) on the curve where b=y(a). The tangent line\nthrough this point will go through (a,b) and have slope y'(a) where y'\nis the derivative. Therefore the tangent line L(x) will satisfy\n\n\\[\\displaystyle{}L(x)=y'(a)(x-a)+y(a).\\]\n\nWe know that y=1/x and so\n\n\\[y(a)=\\frac{1}{a}.\\]\n\nNext we calculate the derivative:\n\n\\[y'  = -\\frac{1}{x^2}\\]\n\nand plugging in the point x=a we get\n\n\\[y'(a) = -\\frac{1}{a^2}.\\]\n\nUp to this point we have enough information to compute the tangent line\nfor any point x=a on the curve. However, we are looking for the two\npoints where the slope is parallel (therefore equal) to -100, the slope\nof the line given in the question. This gives the equation:\n\n\\[-\\frac{1}{a^2} = -100\\]\n\nSolving for a, we get\n\n\\[a = \\pm \\frac{1}{10}.\\]\n\nTherefore, we need to find the equation of the tangent line where\n\\emph{a = -1/10} and \\emph{a = 1/10}.\n\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\itemsep1pt\\parskip0pt\\parsep0pt\n\\item\n  When \\emph{a = -1/10},\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\[y(a) = y(-1/10) = \\frac{1}{-1/10} = -10\\]\n\nand the slope is $m = -100$ (because the lines are parallel). Therefore,\nthe equation of the tangent line is\n\n\\[\\displaystyle{}L(x) = -100(x - (-1/10)) + (-10)\\]\n\nThis is a sufficient answer, but if you simplify to \\emph{y=mx + b}\nform, you find instead that \\emph{L(x) = -100x -20}.\n\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\itemsep1pt\\parskip0pt\\parsep0pt\n\\item\n  When \\emph{a = 1/10},\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\[y(a) = y(-1/10) = \\frac{1}{1/10} = 10,\\]\n\nwith slope $m = -100$. Therefore, the equation of the tangent line is\n\n\\[\\displaystyle{}L(x) = -100(x - 1/10) + 10.\\]\n\nThis is a sufficient answer, but if you simplify to \\emph{y=mx + b}\nform, you find \\emph{L(x) = -100x +20}"
