        "We would use disc integration to evaluate this volume. First, we need to\ndetermine the $x$ values that define the endpoints of the interval that\nwe need to integrate over. The endpoints are where the curves intersect,\nso we solve $4 - x^{2} = 2 - x$ or\n\n\\[x^{2} - x - 2 = 0 \\quad \\rightarrow \\quad (x - 2)(x + 1) = 0\\]\n\nThus, the endpoints of the interval $x = -1$ and $x = 2$. Since we are\nusing the disc method, we recall that the volume of a single disc with\nradius $r$ and thickness $\\Delta x$ is $\\pi r^{2} \\Delta x$. Since we\nare rotating each curve about the $x$-axis, we can treat the value of\nthe function as the height of each disc.\n\nBy taking a sample point in the interval $(-1,2)$, we can see that\n$4 - x^{2} > 2 - x$ in the domain of integration so we can get the\nvolume of the defined solid by taking the volume of the solid with\nradius $4 - x^{2}$ and subtracting the volume with radius $2 - x$.\n\n\\begin{align*}\nV &= \\int_{-1}^{2}\\pi (4 - x^{2})^{2}\\,dx - \\int_{-1}^{2}\\pi (2 - x)^{2}\\,dx \\\\\n&= \\pi \\int_{-1}^{2} (4 - x^{2})^{2} - (2 - x)^{2}\\,dx\n\\end{align*}\n\n(Note: If you wish to evaluate the integral, the volume of the solid\nobtained by rotating the region $R$ about the $x$-axis is\n$V = 108\\pi/5$.)"
