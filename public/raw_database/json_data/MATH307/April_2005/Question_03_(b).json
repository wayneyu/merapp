    "statement": "Let \\emph{P} be a real symmetric \\emph{n x n} matrix such that\n\\emph{P\\textsuperscript{2} = P}. Also let \\emph{R = I\\textsubscript{n} -\n2P} be the matrix that reflects a vector across a plane.\n\n\\textbf{(b)} If \\emph{P} is the matrix of the projection of\n$\\mathbb{R}^n$ onto a subspace \\emph{V} and if \\emph{Q} is the matrix of\nthe projection of $\\mathbb{R}^n$ onto the orthogonal complement\n$V^\\perp$, explain (either algebraically or geometrically) why \\emph{PQ\n= 0} and \\emph{RQ = Q}.",

        "Why is $PQ = 0$\n\n$Px$ is in the subspace$V$ and $Qx$ will be in the subspace orthogonal\nto $V$. So it is easy to imagine that if $y$ is in $V$ then $Qy$ will be\nthe zero vector meaning $Qy = 0$. To get a vector in $V$ from any vector\nin$R^n$ we simply use $y = Px$. Substituting this into the first\nequation we get $Q(Px) = QPx = 0$ and because x does not have to be a\nzero vector $QP=0$. The same logic is true for the opposite case so\n$PQ=0$.\n\nTo see RQ = Q we can solve algebraically\n\n$RQ = (I - 2P)Q = Q - 2PQ$\n\nbut as seen above $PQ = 0$\n\nso $Q - 2PQ = Q$"
