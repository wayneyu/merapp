        "In this case we need to use logarithmic differentiation, indeed it is\nimpossible to use the power rule since there is an $x^2$ as exponent. We\ncannot differentiate it in the same way we do for exponential functions\nsince we take the power of \\emph{x} and not \\emph{e} or another\nconstant. Hence we need to use logarithmic differentiation. First set\n\n\\begin{align*}y=x^{(x^2)},\\end{align*} then taking the logarithm on both sides we find\n\n\\begin{align*}\\ln y = \\ln (x^{(x^2)}) = x^2 \\ln(x).\\end{align*} Now keeping in mind that\n\\emph{y} is a function of \\emph{x}, we can take the derivatives on both\nsides and get\n\n\\begin{align*}\\frac{d}{dx} \\ln y = \\frac{d}{dx} (x^2 \\ln(x)) .\\end{align*} The left-hand side\nis simply\n\n\\begin{align*}\\frac{d}{dx} \\ln y = \\frac{1}{y} \\cdot \\frac{d}{dx} y = \\frac{1}{y} y',\\end{align*}\nwhile the right-hand side gives, using the product rule,\n\n\\begin{align*}\\frac{d}{dx}(x^2 \\ln(x)) = 2x \\ln(x) + x^2 \\frac{1}{x} =  2x \\ln(x) + x.\\end{align*}\nPutting everything back together, we get\n\n\\begin{align*}\\frac{1}{y} y' = 2x \\ln(x) + x,\\end{align*} and thus\n\n\\begin{align*}\\displaystyle y' = y (2x \\ln(x) + x).\\end{align*} Replacing \\emph{y} by\n$x^{(x^2)},$ we finally get\n\n\\begin{align*}y' = x^{(x^2)} ( 2x \\ln(x) + x).\\end{align*}"
