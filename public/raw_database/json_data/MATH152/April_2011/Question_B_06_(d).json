        "We have 3 equations in 2 unknowns. We know that if we have $n$ unknowns\nthen we require $n$ equations for a unique solution. Therefore, in this\ncase we only need two of the equations to uniquely determine the\ncomponents of a solution vector \\textbf{x}. The only way it will satisfy\nall three equations is if the third equation happens to be equivalent to\none of the other two equations. Since we want no solution, we will\nrequire the three equations to produce contradicting information. As an\nexample, take the augmented matrix,\n\n\\begin{align*}\\left[\\begin{array}{cc|c}\n1  &  0  &  2\\\\\n0  &  1  &  3\\\\\n0  &  1  &  5\n\\end{array}\\right].\\end{align*}\n\nFor a solution vector \\textbf{x}, with components $x_1$ and $x_2$, the\nmatrix claims\n\n\\begin{align*}\nx_1&=2,\\\\\nx_2&=3,\\\\\nx_2&=5.\\end{align*}\n\nTwo of the equations are contradicting each other and therefore there is\nno solution. This matrix is not in reduced row-echelon form because of\nthe last row. If we put it in that form,\n\n\\begin{align*}\\left[\\begin{array}{cc|c}\n1  &  0  &  2\\\\\n0  &  1  &  3\\\\\n0  &  0  &  2\n\\end{array}\\right]\\end{align*}\n\nwe see the other type of indicator for no solution that occurred in\n\\href{Science:Math_Exam_Resources/Courses/MATH152/April_2011/Question_B6_(c)}{part\n(c)}."

        "In order for no solution to occur we require contradictory information\nsuch as a variable trying to take on two values."
