        "Recall that the definition of an inverse of \\emph{A} denoted\n\\emph{A}\\textsuperscript{-1} is\n\n\\begin{align*}\\displaystyle{}AA^{-1}=A^{-1}A=I\\end{align*}\n\nwhere \\emph{I} is the identity. Now assume we want to solve\n\\emph{A}\\textbf{x} = 0 for some \\textbf{x}. If \\emph{A} is invertible\nthen by the above property we can left multiply by\n\\emph{A}\\textsuperscript{-1} to get\n\n\\begin{align*}\\mathbf{x}=A^{-1}0=0\\end{align*}\n\nso we conclude that if \\emph{A} is invertible then \\emph{A}\\textbf{x} =\n0 only has \\textbf{x} = 0, the trivial solution and that \\textbf{option\nc is correct}.\n\nNow assume we wanted to find eigenvalues \\emph{A\\textbf{\\emph{v}' =\n''\u03bb}}v\\textbf{. If we wanted to find zero eigenvalues then we'd need to\nsolve \\emph{A}}v''' = 0 but as we saw above, the only solution to this\nif \\emph{A} is invertible is \\textbf{v} = 0 which is not a valid\neigenvector. Therefore, if \\emph{A} is invertible then it does not have\nany zero eigenvalues and \\textbf{option d is correct}.\n\nA square matrix \\emph{A} of size \\emph{n} \u00d7 \\emph{n} always has \\emph{n}\neigenvalues. If the matrix has rank \\emph{r} then there are always\n\\emph{r} non-zero eigenvalues and \\emph{n} \u2212 \\emph{r} zero eigenvalues.\nSince in this case we have shown that there are no zero eigenvalues then\n\\emph{n} \u2212 \\emph{r} = 0 or \\emph{n} = \\emph{r}, thus the matrix \\emph{A}\nhas rank \\emph{n} and \\textbf{option a is correct}.\n\nRecall that rank has to do with the number of pivots in a row reduced\nmatrix. If \\emph{A} has full rank (rank \\emph{n}) then there will be\n\\emph{n} pivots which means two things. We have shown that all\ninvertible matrices have rank \\emph{n}. Firstly this means that the row\nreduced form of \\emph{A} is the identity matrix (since it has \\emph{n}\npivots) so \\textbf{option b is correct} and secondly it means that there\nare no rows of zeros which means that det(\\emph{A}) $\\neq$ 0, so\n\\textbf{option e is correct}.\n\nTherefore, from starting with the definition of an inverse we were able\nto deduce that \\textbf{all} of the options are correct."
