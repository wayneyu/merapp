        "As calculated in\n\\href{Science:Math_Exam_Resources/Courses/MATH152/April_2013/Question_A_04}{A04},\nwe take $\\displaystyle q=1, p=0$,\n\n\\begin{align*}M = \\begin{pmatrix}1 & 7 & 3 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 5 \\\\ 1 & 7 & 8 \\end{pmatrix}.\\end{align*}\n\nSince $\\displaystyle M$ has rank 2, the columns in $\\displaystyle M$\nmust be linear dependent. We see that the second column is 7 times the\nfirst column. Hence, the second column is redundant.\n\nThe first and the third column of $\\displaystyle M$ are linearly\nindependent since the third one has a 5 as second entry, where the first\none has a 0. Therefore, there is no possible scalar such that columns 1\nand 3 are multiples.\n\n\\begin{align*}\\displaystyle Mx = b\\end{align*} is only solvable, if $\\displaystyle b$ is a\nlinear combination of the columns of $\\displaystyle M$.\n\nWe want to find a vector, which is not a linear combination of the two\nlinear independent columns. Once possible choice is to find a vector\nwhich orthogonal (and hence linear independent) to the first and third\ncolumn by performing the cross product,\n\n\\begin{align*}b = \\begin{pmatrix}1\\\\0\\\\1\\end{pmatrix} \\times\\begin{pmatrix}3\\\\5\\\\8\\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -5 \\\\ -5 \\\\ 5\\end{pmatrix}.\\end{align*}\n\nNote that there are several choices that could be made and this method\nis just a quick and effective way for finding a suitable vector."
