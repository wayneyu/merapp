        "Elementary row operations don't change the solution of a homogeneous\nequation, hence the solutions of \\emph{Ux = 0} also solve \\emph{Ax = 0}.\n\nFrom the first row on matrix U, we have\n$\\mathbf{x_{1}} = 7\\mathbf{x_{3}}$.\n\nFrom the second row on matrix U, we have\n$\\mathbf{x_{2}} = -4\\mathbf{x_{3}}$.\n\nHence the general solution to is\n$\\begin{bmatrix}\\mathbf{x_{1}}\\\\ \\mathbf{x_{2}}\\\\ \\mathbf{x_{3}}\\end{bmatrix} = a\\begin{bmatrix}7\\\\\n-4\\\\1\\end{bmatrix}$, where a is any real number."

        "The matrix \\emph{U} describes a system of two equations and three\nunknowns. Hence the homogeneous system has at least one free parameter,\nand hence infinitely many solutions."
