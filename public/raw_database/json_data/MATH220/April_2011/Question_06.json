        "Let us first assume that $n \\equiv 3 \\pmod 5$. This is equivalent to the\nstatement that $5 \\mid (n - 3)$ or that there exists some integer $k$ so\nthat $n - 3 = 5k$ or that $n = 5k + 3$. In such a case, we have that\n\n\\begin{align*}3n + 1 = 3(5k + 3) + 1 = 5(3k) + 10 = 5(3k + 2)\\end{align*}\n\nand so since $3k+2$ is an integer, it follows that $5 \\mid (3n + 1)$.\n\nSo suppose now that $5 \\mid (3n+1)$; that is, there is some integer\n$\\ell$ so that $5 \\ell = 3n + 1$. From this we can conclude that\n\n\\begin{align*}5\\ell = 3n + 1 \\iff 5(2\\ell) = 6n + 2 = 5n + n + 5 - 3 = 5(n+1) + n - 3\\end{align*}\n\nShifting the first of those terms to the other side we obtain that\n\n\\begin{align*}5 (2\\ell - n - 1) = n - 3\\end{align*}\n\nSince $2\\ell - n - 1$ is an integer, the result is proven.", 
        "Let us first show that if \\emph{n} is congruent to 3 mod 5, then\n3\\emph{n}+1 is divisible by 5, that is, 3\\emph{n}+1 is congruent to 0\nmod 5.\n\nSince we know that\n\n\\begin{align*}\\displaystyle n \\equiv 3 \\pmod 5\\end{align*} We can substitute this in the\nexpression of 3\\emph{n}+1 and obtain that\n\n\\begin{align*}\n3n+1 &\\equiv 3(3)+1 \\pmod 5\\\\\n&\\equiv 10 \\pmod 5\\\\\n&\\equiv 0 \\pmod 5\\end{align*} Which proves that 3\\emph{n}+1 is\ndivisible by 5.\n\nNow, let's prove the converse, that is that if 3\\emph{n}+1 is divisible\nby 5, then \\emph{n} is congruent to 3 mod 5.\n\nWe start with the fact that is 3\\emph{n}+1 is divisible by 5, then it is\ncongruent to 0 mod 5 and write\n\n\\begin{align*}\\displaystyle 3n+1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 5\\end{align*} Which we can rewrite as\n\n\\begin{align*}\n3n &\\equiv -1 \\pmod 5\\\\\n&\\equiv 4 \\pmod 5\\end{align*} We would like to get some information\nabout \\emph{n}, not 3\\emph{n} but division in modular arithmetic is\ntricky. In this case, since 3 and 5 are coprime, we know it can be done:\nthe inverse of 3 mod 5 is 2 since 2$\\cdot$3=6 which is 1 mod 5. So we\nmultiply both sides of the equation by 2 and obtain\n\n\\begin{align*}\\displaystyle 6n \\equiv 8 \\pmod 5\\end{align*} And so since 6 is 1 mod 5 and 8 is\n3 mod 5 we can conclude that\n\n\\begin{align*}\\displaystyle n \\equiv 3 \\pmod 5\\end{align*} Which shows that \\emph{n} is\ncongruent to 3 mod 5 and finishes our proof."
