        "Using hint 2 provided, we may immediatley rewrite $f(t)$ as\n\n\\[f(t)=-\\int_2^{t^4} \\sqrt{1+x^3}dx\\]\n\nWe would like to use hint 1, but this only works if the upper limit of\nintegration is $t$, which in this case is not true. So define for the\ntime being\n\n\\[g(u) = -\\int_2^u \\sqrt{1 + x^3}dx\\].\n\nFrom hint 1, we see immediately that $g'(u) = -\\sqrt{1 + u^3}$. We also\nsee that $f(t) = g(t^4)$. Using the chain rule we can then compute that\n\n\\[f'(t) = g'(t^4) \\frac{du}{dt} = -\\sqrt{1 + (t^{4})^3}(4t^3) = -4t^3\\sqrt{1 + t^{12}}\\]."
