        "To solve this question, we begin by finding the equation of the tangent\nline to the function $\\displaystyle f(x) = \\ln(x)$. Differentiating\ngives us $f'(x) = \\frac1{x}$ and plugging in $\\displaystyle a=1$ we\nobtain the $y$ value of $\\displaystyle y = \\ln(1) = 0$. Using the point\nslope formula, we have at the point $\\displaystyle (1,0)$\n\n$\\displaystyle \\frac{y-0}{x-1} = 1$\n\nSolving gives\n\n$\\displaystyle y = x-1$\n\nThus, the approximation we seek is given by\n\n$\\displaystyle y = 1.25-1 = 0.25$."
