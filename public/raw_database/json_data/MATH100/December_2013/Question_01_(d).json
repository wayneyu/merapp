        "Since the bacterial culture grows at a rate proportional to its size, we\ncan say that $\\frac{dy}{dt} = ky$, where $\\displaystyle y(t)$ is the\nnumber of bacteria at time $\\displaystyle t$ (in hours).\n\nThe solution to this differential equation is:\\\\$\\displaystyle \ny(t) = y(0)e^{kt}$\\\\\\\\ We are given that $\\displaystyle y(0) = 50$ and\n$\\displaystyle y(1) = 250$, so we can solve for $\\displaystyle k$ as\nfollows:\n\n\\begin{align*}\ny(1) &= y(0)e^{k\\cdot1}\n\\\\ 250 &= 50e^k\n\\\\ 5 &= e^k\n\\\\ k &= \\ln5\n\\\\\n\\\\ \\therefore y(t) &= 50e^{\\ln(5)t}\n\\\\ &= {\\color{blue} 50 \\cdot 5^t}\\end{align*}"
