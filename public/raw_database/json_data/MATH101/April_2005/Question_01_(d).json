        "This is a 2nd-order differential equation with constant coefficients. So\nmake the substitution of $y = e^{rx}$ into the equation and solve for\n$r$.\n\n\\begin{align*}\ny'' - 2y' + y &= 0 \\\\\nr^{2}e^{rx} - 2re^{rx} + e^{rx} &= 0 \\\\\ne^{rx}\\left(r^{2} - 2r + 1 \\right) &= 0 \\\\ \\rightarrow \\quad e^{rx} = 0 \\quad \\mbox{or}& \\quad r^{2} - 2r + 1 = 0\n\\end{align*} Solving for $r$ we find that there is a double root\n$r = 1$. Thus we have found that one solution is $y(x) = e^{x}$, but we\nneed to find a second solution. We multiply the first solution by $x$\nand confirm that it is indeed a solution of the above equation (i.e: Let\n$y = xe^{x}$ be another possible solution and substitute it into the\ndifferential equation).\n\n\\begin{align*}\ny'' - 2y' + y &= \\left(2e^{x} + xe^{x}\\right) - 2\\left(xe^{x} + e^{x}\\right) + xe^{x}\\\\\n&= 2e^{x} + xe^{x} - 2xe^{x} - 2e^{x} + xe^{x} \\\\\n&= 0\n\\end{align*}\n\nThus, the general solution is $\\,y(x) = c_{1}e^{x} + c_{2}xe^{x}$, where\n$c_{1},\\,c_{2}$ are arbitrary constants."

        "This is a 2nd order differential equation with constant coefficients.\nSo, you can begin by assuming that the general solution is the sum of\ntwo exponential functions, each of the form $y = ce^{rx}$, where $c$ is\na constant.\n\n(Remember that there are special cases where solutions of the\ndifferential equation may look like sines and cosines, or may include a\nlinear term in front of the exponential term.)"
