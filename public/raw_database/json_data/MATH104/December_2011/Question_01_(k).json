        "The correct answer is (d). Let's examine each possibility.\n\n(a) Since $g(x)$ is continuous, we can use the extreme value theorem\nwhich says exactly what (a) is telling us - there is a maximum value on\nthe interval $[0,1]$\n\n(b) This is saying that if two values are equal then their function\nvalues are equal. Since a function can only take one output value for\neach input value, this is a true statement.\n\n(c) Since $g(0) = 1 > 1/2 > 0 = g(1)$ and $g(x)$ is continuous, then the\nintermediate value theorem tells us exactly what this statement says,\nthere is a value \\emph{c} in $[0,1]$ such that $g(c) = 1/2$\n\n(d) This statement is false. The difference between (c) and this problem\nis that the number 3/2 does not lie between $g(0)$ and $g(1)$. A counter\nexample would be a straight line joining $g(0)$ and $g(1)$. This can be\ndescribed by $y = -x + 1$.\n\n(e) This is true as this is the definition of continuity and $g(x)$ is\ngiven to be continuous."
