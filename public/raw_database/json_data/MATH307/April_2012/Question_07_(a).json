        "We can actually infer all the information we need to answer this\nquestion from the matrix A that was given. Let us first rewrite the\nmatrix A in the context of how it is used:\n\n$\\begin{bmatrix}\nx_{n+1}\\\\\nx_{n}\\\\\nx_{n-1}\n\\end{bmatrix} =\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n\n0 & 2 & 1 \\\\\n\n1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n\n0 & 1 & 0\n\n\\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix}\nx_{n}\\\\\nx_{n-1}\\\\\nx_{n-2}\n\\end{bmatrix}$\n\nThis equation yields the following three linear equations:\n\n\\begin{align*}\nx_{n+1} &= 2x_{n-1} + x_{n-2}\\\\\nx_{n} &= x_{n}\\\\\nx_{n-1} &= x_{n-1}\n\\end{align*}\n\nThe first equation of this set of linear equations tells us the\nrecursive relationship for this matrix and notice that to calculate the\nvalue for the $n^{th}$ value in the relationship where $n > 2$ and $n$\nis an integer, we only need the first three values to be initially\nstated.\n\nIn summary, the recursive sequence that is inferred from A is:\n\n$\\displaystyle x_{n+1} = 2x_{n-1} + x_{n-2}$\n\nand we would need the first three values of the sequence to calculate\nall the following values in the sequence ($x_{0}, x_{1},$ and $x_{3}$)."
