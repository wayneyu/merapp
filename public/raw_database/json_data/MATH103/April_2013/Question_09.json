        "There are three key values to note - what happens at \\emph{a} and what\nhappens at the two locations where the function goes from positive to\nnegative?", 
        "Don't forget, if you start at \\emph{a} and go left you actually get more\nnegative since integrals also encode a sense of direction.", 
        "Your function should be smooth (meaning differentiable everywhere - so\nno corners allowed!)"
