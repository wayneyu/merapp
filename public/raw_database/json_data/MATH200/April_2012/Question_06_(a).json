Looking at where the lines meet, we can see that\nthe bounds of integration for x is x = -1 to x = 2. (To find these\nintersection points solve the equation $x^{2} = x + 2$.)\n\nFrom these observations, we can write I as follows\\[{\\color{blue}\nI = \\int_{-1}^{2}\\int_{x^{2}}^{x + 2}f(x,y)\\,\\textrm{d}y\\textrm{d}x\n}\\]"
