    "statement": "A steel company, ABC steel, manufactures nuts and bolts. When x nuts are\nproduced, they can be sold for\n\n\\[\\displaystyle{}-3x+500\\]\n\ndollars each. When y bolts are produced, they can be sold for\n\n\\[\\displaystyle{}-y+300\\]\n\ndollars each.\n\nAssume that nuts and bolts weigh 0.5kg each. How many nuts and how many\nbolts must be produced to maximize the revenue from 100kg of steel?\nJustify your answer.",

        "In this optimization problem, we want to maximize our revenue, so our\nobjective function is\n\n\\begin{align*}\nR &= (\\mbox{number of nuts sold})(\\mbox{price per nut})\\\\\n&\\,\\, + (\\mbox{number of bolts sold})(\\mbox{price per bolt})\\\\\n&= (x)(-3x + 500) + (y)(-y + 300) \\\\\n&= 500x + 300y - 3x^{2} - y^{2}.\n\\end{align*} Since nuts and bolts weigh 0.5kg each and we only have\n100kg of steel, our constraint becomes\n\n\\[\\displaystyle 0.5x + 0.5y = 100.\\] Using the constraint, we can\nexpress the objective function in terms of just one variable. Solving\nfor $y$ gives $y = 200 - x$. Substituting into $R$ we get,\n\n\\begin{align*}\nR &= 500x + 300(200 - x) - 3x^{2} - (200 - x)^{2} \\\\\n&= 20000 + 600x - 4x^{2}\n\\end{align*} We will only concern ourselves with values of $x > 0$\nsince we can't sell negative numbers of nuts. To determine the critical\npoints, solve $R'(x) = 0$ for $x$.\n\n\\begin{align*}\n\\displaystyle{}R'(x) = 600 - 8x &=0\\\\\nx&=\\frac{600}{8}=75.\n\\end{align*}\n\nSince this is the only critical point of $R$, if we can show that\n$R''(75) < 0$, then $R$ has a global maximum at $x = 75$.\n\nWe have that\n\n\\[\\displaystyle{}R''(x)=-8\\]\n\nand so $\\displaystyle {}R''(x)<0$ for all x. Therefore,\n$R''(75) = -8 < 0$, and $R$ has a global maximum at $x = 75$. The\ncorresponding value of bolts is $y = 125$. Therefore, we should sell 75\nnuts and 125 bolts to maximize revenue."
