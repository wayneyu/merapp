    "statement": "A CT scanner in a hospital is switched on every morning and switched off\nat night. The scanner has a probability $\\displaystyle q = 0.001$ of\nfailure when the technician turns it on in the morning. (Assume that if\nit turns on, it will not fail later that day i.e. treat this as a\n\\textbf{discrete} event. Also assume that failure is independent of age\nor history of the machine.)\n\n(b) Use your\n\\href{Science:Math Exam Resources/Courses/MATH103/April 2005/Question 06 (a)}{result\nin (a)} to find the mean time of failure of this machine, i.e. the\nexpected value of the number of the day on which it first fails. You may\nfind it helpful to use the summation formula\n\n\\begin{align*}\n\\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty}kr^{k-1} = \\frac{1}{(1-r)^{2}}\n\\end{align*}\n\nfor $\\displaystyle |r| < 1$",
