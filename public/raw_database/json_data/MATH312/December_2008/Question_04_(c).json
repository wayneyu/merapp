        "Assume towards a contradiction that 1729 is prime. Look at\n\n$\\displaystyle x^{2} \\equiv 1 \\mod{1729}$\n\nIf this were prime, we would have that the only two solutions to this\nequation are given by $\\displaystyle x \\equiv 1 \\mod{1729}$ and\n$\\displaystyle x \\equiv -1 \\mod{1729}$ (if you haven't seen this before,\nisolate for 0, factor and argue that because we've assumed that 1729 is\nprime, it has to divide one of the factors). However, notice that from\nthe given congruences, we have that\n$\\displaystyle 2^{18} \\not\\equiv \\pm 1 \\mod{1729}$ but\n\n$\\displaystyle (2^{18})^{2} \\equiv 2^{36} \\equiv 1 \\mod{1729}$\n\nand this is a contradiction. Hence 1729 is not prime."
