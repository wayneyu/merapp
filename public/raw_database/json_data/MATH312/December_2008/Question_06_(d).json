For $\\displaystyle m=1$,\nthe theorem holds trivially, so we assume from now on that\n$\\displaystyle m > 1$ and write its prime-power factorization as\n$\\displaystyle m = p_{1}^{e_{1}} \\cdot ... \\cdot p_{k}^{e_{k}}$ for\ndifferent primes $\\displaystyle p_{1},...,p_{k}$ and positive integer\nexponents $\\displaystyle e_{1},...,e_{k}$ and some positive integer\n\\emph{k}. Let $\\displaystyle i \\in \\{1,..,k\\}$ and focus on the prime\npower $\\displaystyle p_{i}^{e_{i}}$ in the prime-power factorization of\n\\emph{m}.\n\n\\textbf{(d)} Complete the proof of Theorem 1 above",

Since they are\nall distinct primes, the fact that\n\n$\\displaystyle p_{i}^{e_{i}} \\mid (a^{m} - a^{m-\\phi(m)})$\n\nholds for each $\\displaystyle i \\in \\{1,..,k\\}$ will together imply that\nvia the Chinese Remainder Theorem\n\n$\\displaystyle m = \\prod_{i=1}^{k}p_{i}^{e_{i}} \\mid (a^{m} - a^{m-\\phi(m)})$\n\nand this completes the proof."
