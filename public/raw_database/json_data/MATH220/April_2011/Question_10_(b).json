        "The sequence \\{\\emph{a}\\textsubscript{\\emph{n}}\\} is bounded, which\nmeans that there exists a real number \\emph{M} such that\n\n\\[\\displaystyle\n| a_n | \\leq M \\quad \\text{for all } n \\geq 1\\]\n\nHence the supremum of all the numbers \\emph{a}\\textsubscript{\\emph{n}}\nis at most \\emph{M} and by definition of the numbers\n\\emph{b}\\textsubscript{\\emph{n}} we have that\n\n\\[\\displaystyle\n|b_n| \\leq M \\quad \\text{for all } n \\geq 1\\] or in other words, the\nsequence \\{\\emph{b}\\textsubscript{\\emph{n}}\\} is bounded as well.

        "To show that a decreasing sequence \\emph{b}\\textsubscript{\\emph{n}}\nconverges, you have to show that it is bounded.\n\nLet's consider a few simpler examples to understand the relation between\n\\emph{a}\\textsubscript{\\emph{n}} and \\emph{b}\\textsubscript{\\emph{n}}\nbetter.\n\nE.g. consider the sequence\n\n\\[a_n = (-1)^n \\quad \\text{for all } n \\geq 1\\]\n\nor the other sequence\n\n\\[a_n = \\sin\\left(\\frac{n}{10}\\right) \\quad \\text{for all } n \\geq 1\\]\n\nBoth sequences are bounded and satisfy\n\n\\[-1 \\leq a_n \\leq 1 \\quad\\text{for all } n \\geq 1\\]\n\nNow in each case, consider the corresponding sequence\n\\emph{b}\\textsubscript{\\emph{n}} as describe in the question and\nobserve. Note that those two cases are fairly easy as what will happen\nto that sequence (which you should be able to show converges).\n\nA more subtle case to consider after these two is the case of the\nsequence\n\n\\[a_n = \\frac{n+10}{n}\\sin\\left(\\frac{n}{10}\\right) \\quad \\text{for all } n \\geq 1\\]\nNotice that the first rational term converges to 1, but because of the\nsine term, that sequence will never converge. What will happen to the\ncorresponding sequence \\emph{b}\\textsubscript{\\emph{n}} in this case?\nWhy does \\emph{b}\\textsubscript{\\emph{n}} converge?"
