        "A function is non-differentiable if it has a vertical tangent or a sharp\ncorner (cusp). A function is continuous if it can be drawn in one go\nwithout lifting your pencil. It is possible to draw a continuous\nfunction with one (or multiple!) of the non-differentiable properties\njust listed:\n\n\\includegraphics[width=.5\\textwidth]{MER_MATH110_December_2012_Question_2e_cusp_example.jpg}\n\\includegraphics[width=.5\\textwidth]{MER_MATH110_December_2012_Question_2e_vertical_tangent.jpg}\n\nSo a function can be continuous, without necessarily being\ndifferentiable. Thus the statement is false."
