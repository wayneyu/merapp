        "Given a relation or rule that takes input values (usually denoted\n\\emph{x}) and produces output values (usually denoted \\emph{y}), the\nrelation is a function if each \\emph{x}-value is associated with only\none \\emph{y}-value. In other words, the graph of the relation must pass\nthe ``vertical line test'' - if you can draw a vertical line that\nintersects the graph at two points, the relation is not a function.\n\nIn this case, a single \\emph{x}-value in the domain will be associated\nwith two \\emph{y}-values from the upper and lower half of the circle.\nThis is the same as saying that a circle fails the vertical line test,\nas a vertical line drawn through any point in the domain will intersect\nthe graph in two places."
