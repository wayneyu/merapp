        "Two planes are parallel if their normal vectors are parallel. Hence, we\nwill evaluate the normal vectors for the given plane and the function \u00c6\u0092\nto determine the points where they are parallel.\n\nBy inspection of the equation of the plane 2x + 2y - z = 3, we can see\nthat is normal vector is $\\mathbf{n}_{1} = [2,2,-1]^{T}$.\n\nThe normal vector to the function \u00c6\u0092 at the point (x,y) is given by\ncomputing the gradient to F(x,y,z) = \u00c6\u0092(x,y) - z:\n\n\\[\\nabla F(x,y,z) = \\left[F_{x}(x,y,z),F_{y}(x,y,z),F_{z}(x,y,z)\\right]^{T} = \\left[\\frac{8x}{4x^{2} + y^{2}},\\frac{2y}{4x^{2} + y^{2}},-1 \\right]^{T}.\\]\nHence, to determine points where the normal vectors are parallel, we\nneed to solve the following two equations for (x,y):\n\n\\[\\frac{8x}{4x^{2} + y^{2}} = 2, \\quad \\frac{2y}{4x^{2} + y^{2}} = 2\\]\nTaking the difference of the two equations gives us the condition y =\n4x. Taking this result and plugging it into the first equation above\ngives:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{8x}{4x^{2} + y^{2}} = 2 \\quad \\rightarrow \\quad 8x &= 8x^{2} + 2y^{2} \\\\\n8x &= 8x^{2} + 32x^{2} \\\\\nx &= 5x^{2}\n\\end{align*} This equation has two solutions: x = 0 and x = 1/5. Notice\nthat the x = 0 is invalid since the corresponding value of y is y = 4x =\n0 and \u00c6\u0092 is undefined at (0,0). Therefore, the only valid solution is x\n= 1/5 which corresponds to y = 4x = 4/5. The corresponding value of z is\nz = \u00c6\u0092(1/5,4/5) = ln(4/5).\n\nTherefore, the tangent plane to \u00c6\u0092 is parallel to 2x + 2y - z = 3 at the\npoint P(a,b,c) = (1/5,4/5,ln(4/5))."
