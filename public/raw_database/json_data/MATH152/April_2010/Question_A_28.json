        "a. $\\displaystyle (AB)C=A(BC)$\n\nThis is \\textbf{true} and is known as the distributive property. Notice\nwe are not changing the order in which the multiplication occurs, just\nwhich multiplications we are performing first.\n\nb. $\\displaystyle (A+B)(A-B)=A^2-B^2$\n\nThis is \\textbf{false}. Let's carefully expand out the left-hand side,\n\n\\[\\displaystyle{}A^2-AB+BA-B^2\\]\n\nhowever, since matrices do not in general commute then AB is not the\nsame as BA and those terms do not cancel like they do with real numbers.\n\nc. $\\displaystyle A^TB^T=(AB)^T$\n\nThis is \\textbf{false}. The property of transposes is that\n\n\\[\\displaystyle{}(AB)^T=B^TA^T\\]\n\nhowever even without remembering the correct form of the property we can\nconclude that the presented form is wrong. Let A be size n x m and B be\nsize m x n such that $m\\neq{}n$. Notice that AB is a sensible operation\nhere and produces a matrix n x n. If we then transpose the resulting\nmatrix it is also n x n. However, notice that $A^T$ is m x n and $B^T$\nis n x m. Therefore, $A^TB^T$ is m x m which since $m\\neq{n}$ is not the\nsame size as n x n and therefore the property can not hold for all\nmatrices.\n\nd. $\\displaystyle (A^T)^{-1}=(A^{-1})^T$\n\nThis is \\textbf{true} and is a consequence of the transpose property,\n\n\\[\\displaystyle{}(AB)^T=B^TA^T.\\]\n\ne. $(rA)^{-1}=\\frac{1}{r}A^{-1}$\n\nThis is \\textbf{true} (as long as the scalar is non-zero which is given)\nand is a property of inverses.\n\n\\emph{Therefore, a,d, and e are true.}"

        "Carefully review your linear algebra rules. One very important\ndifference from numbers to matrices is that in general matrices do not\ncommute, i.e.\n\n\\[AB\\neq{}BA\\]"
