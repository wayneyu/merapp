    "statement": "Consider a matrix $\\displaystyle A \\in \\mathbb{C}^{n\\times n}$, a real\ndiagonal matrix $\\displaystyle S^2$ containing the eigenvalues of\n$\\displaystyle A^{*}A$ (all positive) and a matrix \\emph{V} that\ndiagonalizes $\\displaystyle A^{*}A$. Answer the following questions,\nsubstantiate all your statements.\n\nFrom (a) and (b) it follows that $\\displaystyle AA^{*}$ and\n$\\displaystyle A^{*}A$ have the same eigenvalues. How are their\neigenvectors connected?",

        "From (a). Since $\\displaystyle A^{*}A$ is Hermitian, it can be\ndiagonalized with a unitary matrix $\\displaystyle A^{*}A = VS^{2}V^{*}$\nand let $\\displaystyle U = AVS^{-1}$. We found that $U$ is unitary,\nsince\n\n$\\displaystyle U^{*}U = S^{-1}S^2S^{-1} = I$\n\nFrom (b). With this definition of $U$ being unitary, we showed that $U$\ndiagonalises $\\displaystyle AA^*$.\n\n$\\displaystyle US^2U^* = AVS^{-1}S^2S^{-1}V^*A^* = AA^*$\n\nWe have shown from (a) and (b) that $\\displaystyle A^*A$ and\n$\\displaystyle AA^*$ have the same eigenvalues\n$\\displaystyle \\sigma_{i}^{2}$. (recapped above).\n\nThe eigenvectors connect through the singular values of A, which are\n$\\sigma_i$ in the matrix $S$.\n\nThus we can write that the matrix $\\displaystyle A = USV^*$."
