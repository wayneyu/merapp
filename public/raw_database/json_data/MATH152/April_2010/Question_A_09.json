        "From the current loop rule we know that each loop gets its own current\nwhich is an unknown for the system. We also need an unknown for the\nvoltage drop that occurs across each current source. Since we have three\nloops we have \\textbf{3} loop currents, $i_1,i_2,i_3$ and we have one\ncurrent source so we have \\textbf{1} unknown voltage drop $v_1$ for\ncurrent source E. Therefore in total we have \\textbf{4} unknowns for our\nlinear system,\n\n\\[\\begin{bmatrix}\ni_1\\\\\ni_2\\\\\ni_3\\\\\nv_1\n\\end{bmatrix}.\\]"
