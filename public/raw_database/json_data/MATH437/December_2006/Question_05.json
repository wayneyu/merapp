    "statement": "Show that if \\emph{d} is an odd squarefree integer then a necessary\ncondition for the equation $\\displaystyle x^2 -d  y^2 = -1$ to have an\ninteger solution is that all the primes dividing \\emph{d} must be of the\nform $\\displaystyle 4n + 1$.",

        "We proceed as in the hints. Suppose that in fact \\emph{d} was of the\nform $\\displaystyle 4n + 3$. Then since\n\n$\\displaystyle (4k + 1)(4m+1) = 4(4km + k + m) + 1$\n\nwe know that there must be a prime \\emph{p} of the form\n$\\displaystyle p = 4j + 3$ that divides \\emph{d}. Reducing modulo\n\\emph{p} gives\n\n$\\displaystyle x^{2} \\equiv -1 \\mod{p}$\n\nThis means that $\\displaystyle \\left(\\frac{-1}{p} \\right) = 1$. However,\nEuler's criterion tells us that\n$\\displaystyle 1 = \\left(\\frac{-1}{p} \\right) \\equiv (-1)^{(p-1)/2} = (-1)^{2j+1} =-1 \\mod{p}$\nand this is a contradiction."
