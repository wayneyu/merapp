    "statement": "Suppose the public key for an RSA cryptosystem is\n$\\displaystyle (n,e) = (85,7)$ and the secret key is\n$\\displaystyle (85,d)$. Show that this cryptosystem is not secure by\nfinding \\emph{d}.\n\nRemarks: Recall that a message \\emph{x} is encoded by\n$\\displaystyle x \\to x^{e} \\mod{n}$ and a received message \\emph{y} is\ndecoded by $\\displaystyle y \\to y^{d} \\mod{n}$. To make this\ncryptosystem secure, one needs to use a much larger \\emph{n}.",

        "As stated in the hint, we seek to find a value of \\emph{d} such that\n\n$\\displaystyle ed \\equiv 1 \\mod{\\phi(n)}$\n\nNotice that\n$\\displaystyle \\phi(n) = \\phi(85) = \\phi(5 \\cdot 17) = \\phi(5)\\phi(17) = 4(16) = 64$.\nSo we need to solve\n\n$\\displaystyle 7d \\equiv 1 \\mod{64}$.\n\nTo do this, we use the Euclidean Algorithm.\n\n\\begin{align*}\n64 &= 7(9) + 1\\end{align*}\n\nHere we are immediately done and so multiplying both sides above by -9\nyields $\\displaystyle d \\equiv -9 \\equiv 55 \\mod{64}$."
