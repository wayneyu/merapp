        "The stated problem is equivalent to showing that\n$\\displaystyle 0 \\equiv a^{4n+1}  - a \\mod{10}$ which is equivalent to\nshowing that 10 divides $\\displaystyle a(a^{4n}-1)$.\n\nTo do this, we break this into cases. Since we are looking modulo 10, we\nonly have to discuss the cases when\n$\\displaystyle a \\in \\{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9\\}$ since all numbers reduce\nto one of these modulo 10. We proceed as suggested by the hints.\n\n\\textbf{Case 1\\begin{align*}\\displaystyle a=0\\end{align*}}. This case clearly satisfies\n$\\displaystyle a \\equiv a^{4n+1} \\mod{10}$ by a simple substitution. We\nsuppose that \\emph{a} is positive.\n\n\\textbf{Case 2\\begin{align*}\\displaystyle 2 \\mid a\\end{align*}}. In this case, notice that\nclearly 2 divides $\\displaystyle a(a^{4n}-1)$ so it suffices to show\nthat 5 divides $\\displaystyle a^{4n}-1$. Notice that 5 does not divide\n\\emph{a} and so $\\displaystyle \\gcd(a,5) = 1$. Thus Euler's Theorem\napplies giving us that\n\n$\\displaystyle 1 \\equiv a^{\\phi(5)} \\equiv a^{4} \\mod{5}$.\n\nHence\n\n$\\displaystyle a^{4n}-1 \\equiv (a^{4})^{n} - 1 \\equiv 1^{n}-1 \\equiv 0 \\mod{5}$\n\nThus, 5 divides $\\displaystyle a^{4n}-1$ and so 10 divides\n$\\displaystyle a(a^{4n}-1)$.\n\n\\textbf{Case 3\\begin{align*}\\displaystyle a=5\\end{align*}}. In this case, notice that clearly\n5 divides $\\displaystyle a(a^{4n}-1)$ so it suffices to show that 2\ndivides $\\displaystyle a^{4n}-1$. This last number is even since\n$\\displaystyle a^{4n} = 5^{4n}$ is odd. Thus 10 divides\n$\\displaystyle a(a^{4n}-1)$.\n\n\\textbf{Case 4\\begin{align*}\\displaystyle 2 \\nmid a\\end{align*} and $\\displaystyle a \\neq 5$}.\nIn this case, $\\displaystyle \\gcd(a,10) = 1$. Thus Euler's Theorem\napplies giving us that\n\n$\\displaystyle 1 \\equiv a^{\\phi(10)} \\equiv a^{\\phi(2)\\phi(5)} \\equiv a^{(1)(4)} \\equiv a^{4} \\mod{10}$.\n\nHence\n\n$\\displaystyle a(a^{4n}-1) \\equiv a((a^{4})^{n} - 1) \\equiv a(1^{n}-1)\\equiv 0 \\mod{10}$\n\nThus 10 divides $\\displaystyle a(a^{4n}-1)$ completing the proof."
