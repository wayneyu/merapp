        "The true Fourier coefficients as in\n\\href{Science:Math_Exam_Resources/Courses/MATH307/December_2010/Question_06_(a)}{part\n(a)} are given by\n\n\\begin{align*}c_n=\\int_0^1e^{-2\\pi{}inx}x\\textrm{d}x\\end{align*}\n\nwhich we can approximate with a left Riemann sum over N points to get\n\n\\begin{align*}c_n\\approx\\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{j=0}^{N-1}e^{-2\\pi{}in x_j}x_j\\end{align*}\n\nwhere $x_j=\\frac{j}{N}$. Compare this to the discrete Fourier transform\ncoefficients defined by\n\n\\begin{align*}\\tilde{c}_n=\\sum_{j=0}^{N-1}e^{-2\\pi{}in x_j}x_j\\end{align*}\n\nand comparing the expressions we see that\n$c_n\\approx\\frac{1}{N}\\tilde{c}_n$. The discrete Fourier coefficients\ncan be computed in Matlab using the command \\emph{fft}. Therefore, in\nMatlab, we need to sample $x$ over say 100 points and use \\emph{fft},\n\n\\texttt{~~~N~=~100;}\\\\\\texttt{~~~x~=~linspace(0,1,N);}\\\\\\texttt{~~~C~=~fft(x);}\n\nSince $C =[\\tilde{c_0},\\tilde{c_1},\\tilde{c_2},...]$ are the discrete\nFourier coefficients, then the actual Fourier coefficients are given by\n$c_n\\approx\\frac{1}{N}\\tilde{c_n}$ (where in Matlab we arbitrarily chose\nthat N=100).\n\nThe discrete Fourier coefficients are periodic with period $N$ and so\nfrequencies $\\displaystyle {}w_n$ and $\\displaystyle {}w_n+N$ are\nindistinguishable. Particularly this means that modes $-N/2\\leq{}n<0$,\nwill be indistinguishable to modes $\\displaystyle {}N/2<n<N$ since they\ndiffer by period $N$. These negative modes are relevant because they are\nthe complex conjugates to modes $0<n\\leq{}N/2$ and will therefore have\nthe same amplitudes meaning that if a mode on $\\displaystyle {}1<n<N/2$\nhas a high amplitude then so too will its complex conjugate affecting\nthe result on $N/2\\leq{n}<N$. From\n\\href{Science:Math_Exam_Resources/Courses/MATH307/December_2010/Question_06_(a)}{part\n(a)} we see that for the function $f(x)=x$, the amplitudes satisfied\n$|c_n|=\\frac{1}{2\\pi{}n}$ and that the highest amplitudes are for\nintegers closest to zero. Therefore, negative modes slightly less than\nzero have the opportunity to create the biggest errors on modes slightly\ngreater than $N/2$. Conversely, the modes $0\\leq{n}<N/2$ will only be\naffected by modes smaller than $-N/2$ which for functions that behave\nlike $f(x)=x$ will have small amplitudes on that region and thus create\nsmall errors. The amplitudes are therefore most accurate for frequencies\n$0\\leq{}n<\\frac{N}{2}$."
