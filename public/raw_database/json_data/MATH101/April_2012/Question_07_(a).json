        "The formula for the trapezoidal approximation of the integral is as\nfollows:\n\n\\[T_4 = \\frac{\\Delta x}{2} (f(x_0) + 2f(x_1)  + 2f(x_2) + 2f(x_3) + f(x_4))\\]\n\nThe \\emph{4} of $T_4$ means that our interval of integration has been\ndivided into four pieces, each of length \\emph{(b-a)/4=1/4}. So\n$\\Delta x = 1/4$. We also know that $x_0$ and $x_4$ are the endpoints of\nthe interval of integration. So we have\n\n\\begin{align*}\nx_0 &= 1 \\\\\nx_1&= 5/4 \\\\\nx_2 &= 6/4 \\\\\nx_3 &= 7/4 \\\\\nx_4 &= 2 \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\nWe simply plug this all into the formula given above to get:\n\n\\[T_4 = \\frac18 \\left(\\frac1{1} + 2 \\frac1{5/4}  + 2 \\frac1{6/4} + 2 \\frac1{7/4} + \\frac1{2}) \\right)\\]"
