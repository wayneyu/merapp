        "The answer is \\textbf{true}.\n\nSuppose that \\emph{n} has at least two distinct prime divisors \\emph{p}\nand \\emph{q}. Then it has at least 4 positive divisors given by\n$\\displaystyle 1,p,q,pq$. Thus \\emph{n} must only have one prime\ndivisor, so must be of the form $\\displaystyle n = p^{\\alpha}$. In this\ncase, \\emph{n} has exactly $\\displaystyle \\alpha +1$ positive divisors,\nnamely, $\\displaystyle p^\\beta$ for\n$\\displaystyle \\beta = 0,1,2,\\ldots,\\alpha$. Thus if\n$\\displaystyle \\alpha + 1 = 3$ we have that $\\displaystyle \\alpha = 2$\nwhich is as claimed in the question."
