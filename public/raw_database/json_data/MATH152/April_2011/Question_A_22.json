        "If the transition matrix is\n\n\\[P=\\begin{bmatrix}\n8/10  &  3/10  &  1/10\\\\\n2/10  &  3/10  &  7/10\\\\\n0  &  4/10  &  2/10\n\\end{bmatrix}\\]\n\nthen the operation P\\textbf{x}=\\textbf{b} gives us the probability of\nbeing in each of the three states \\textbf{b} based on where we started,\n\\textbf{x}. We are told that we are equally likely to be in any of the\nthree states so we have as our vector,\n\n\\[\\mathbf{x}=\\left[1/3,1/3,1/3\\right].\\]\n\nTo find out the probabilities of being in each state after one\ntransition we compute P\\textbf{x},\n\n\\[P\\mathbf{x}=\\begin{bmatrix}\n8/10  &  3/10  &  1/10\\\\\n2/10  &  3/10  &  7/10\\\\\n0  &  4/10  &  2/10\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1/3\\\\\n1/3\\\\\n1/3\n\\end{bmatrix}\n=\\begin{bmatrix}\n2/5\\\\\n2/5\\\\\n1/5\n\\end{bmatrix}.\\]\n\nTherefore we get that \\textbf{the probability of being in state 3 is\n1/5}. Notice that the output probabilities sum to 1. This is a\nrequirement since we only allow transitions from states 1 to 3, this\nsummation to 1 simply says that no matter where we start we will end up\nsomewhere in states 1 to 3."

        "Recall that a transition matrix with element i,j (row i and column j) is\nthe probability of reaching state i coming from state j. The vector\ninput is the initial states and the vector output is the final states."
