        "The marginal productivity of labour is the rate of change of\nproductivity with respect to the labour investment, so in this case, it\ncorresponds to the partial derivative\n\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}(x,y) &= \\frac{\\partial }{\\partial x}(160x^{3/4}y^{1/4}) \\\\\n&= 160 \\frac{3}{4} x^{-1/4} y^{1/4} \\\\\n&=120 x^{-1/4} y^{1/4}\n\\end{align*}\n\nAnd the marginal productivity of capital is the rate of change of\nproductivity with respect to the capital investment, so in this case, it\ncorresponds to the partial derivative\n\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}(x,y) &= \\frac{\\partial }{\\partial y}(160x^{3/4}y^{1/4}) \\\\\n&= 160 x^{3/4} \\frac{1}{4} y^{-3/4}\\\\\n&= 40 x^{3/4} y^{-3/4}\n\\end{align*}\n\nThe question asks us to compute those marginal productivities for 81\nunits of labour and 16 units of capital, that is to compute\n\n\\[\\displaystyle\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}(81,16) \\quad \\text{and}\\quad \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}(81,16)\\]\nwhich yields\n\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}(81,16) &= 120 \\cdot 81^{-1/4} 16^{1/4}\\\\\n&=120 \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot 2\\\\\n&=80\n\\end{align*} and\n\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}(81,16) &= 40 \\cdot 81^{3/4} 16^{-3/4} \\\\\n&=40 \\cdot 27 \\cdot \\frac{1}{8}\\\\\n&=135\n\\end{align*}\n\nSo the marginal productivity of labour is 80 (dollars of productivity\nper dollar of labour investment) and the marginal productivity of\ncapital is 135 (dollars of productivity per dollar of capital\ninvestment)."
