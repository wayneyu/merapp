        "In\n\\href{Science:Math_Exam_Resources/Courses/MATH152/April_2011/Question_B5_(b)}{part\n(b)} we found that the other two eigenvalues $\\lambda_2$ and $\\lambda_3$\nwere complex conjugates, $1\\pm{}i$. Therefore, the eigenvectors for\n$\\lambda_2$ and $\\lambda_3$ will also occur in complex conjugate pairs.\nIt is then sufficient to just find one of the vectors and then conjugate\nit to find the other. We will solve the vector for $\\lambda_2=1+i$. This\nmeans we are seeking a vector for which\n(A-$\\lambda_2$I)\\textbf{x}=\\textbf{0}.\n\n\\[A-\\lambda_2I=A-(1+i)I=\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n2-i  &  1  &  -3\\\\\n-1  &  -1-i  &  2\\\\\n1  &  0  &  -1-i\n\\end{bmatrix}\\].\n\nIf we denote the vector \\textbf{x} as {[}a,b,c{]} then we need to solve\n\n\\[\\begin{bmatrix}\n2-i  &  1  &  -3\\\\\n-1  &  -1-i  &  2\\\\\n1  &  0  &  -1-i\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\begin{bmatrix}\na\\\\\nb\\\\\nc\n\\end{bmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n0\\\\\n0\\\\\n0\n\\end{bmatrix}\\]\n\nwhich is equivalent to solving\n\n\\begin{align*}\n(2-i)a+b-3c&=0,\\\\\n-a+(-1-i)b+2c&=0,\\\\\na+(-1-i)c=0.\n\\end{align*}\n\nIf we solve this we get a=(1+i)c and b=-ic for arbitrary c. We can set\nc=1 without loss of generality to get that the eigenvector for\n$\\lambda_2$ is\n\n\\[\\mathbf{x}_2=\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1+i\\\\\n-i\\\\\n1\n\\end{bmatrix}.\\]\n\nThis means automatically that the eigenvector for $\\lambda_3$ is just\nthe conjugate of the eigenvector for $\\lambda_2$. Therefore,\n\n\\[\\mathbf{x}_3=\\overline{\\mathbf{x}_2}=\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1-i\\\\\ni\\\\\n1\n\\end{bmatrix}.\\]\n\n\\emph{If you still have trouble computing eigenvectors, it is a\nworthwhile exercise to actually compute $\\mathbf{x}_3$ using the method\nabove and comparing with this result.}"
