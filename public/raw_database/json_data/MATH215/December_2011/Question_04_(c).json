        "We are given the solution to the homogeneous equation. To find the\nsolution with the nonzero right-hand side, we will try variation of\nparameters.\n\nGiven $t^2$ and $t^3$ satisfy the homogeneous ODE, we will make an\nansatz\n\n\\[\\displaystyle{}y = f(t) t^2 + g(t) t^3\\]\n\nwhere f(t) and g(t) are unknown functions. If we differentiate this we\nget\n\n\\[\\displaystyle{}y' = f'(t) t^2 + 2 f(t) t + g'(t) t^3 + 3 g(t) t^2\\]\n\nand to avoid having more than a single derivative upon f and g in\ncomputing $y''$, we will set\n\n\\[\\displaystyle{}f'(t) t^2 + g'(t) t^3 = 0\\]\n\nso that\n\n\\[\\displaystyle{}y' = 2 f(t) t + 3 g(t) t^2.\\]\n\nNotice that by making the assumption, the original first derivative\nremains unchanged. It is important that we make this step, otherwise\nwhen we try to solve the ODE we will have one equation for two unknowns.\nThis assumption adds extra information that allows us to solve the\nproblem. Differentiating again, we get\n\n\\[\\displaystyle{}y'' = 2 f'(t) t + 2 f(t) + 3 g'(t) t^2 + 6 g(t) t.\\]\n\nNow we take our derivatives and substitute them into the original\nequation:\n\n\\[\\displaystyle{}t^2 (2 f'(t) t + 2 f(t) + 3 g'(t) t^2 + 6 g(t) t) - 4t (2 f(t) t + 3 g(t) t^2) + 6 (f(t) t^2 + g(t) t^3) =3t.\\]\n\nAfter expanding and simplifying, we get\n\n\\[\\displaystyle{}2 t^3 f'(t) + 3 t^4 g'(t) = 3t.\\]\n\nNow we have two first-order ODEs for f and g:\n\n\\begin{align*}\nt^2 f' + t^3 g' &= 0 \\\\ \n2t^3 f' + 3t^4 g' &= 3t.\n\\end{align*}\n\nThe first equation implies\n\n\\[\\displaystyle{}f' = -t g'\\]\n\nwhich can be substituted into the second equation:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n\\displaystyle{}-2t^4 g' + 3t^4 g' &= 3t\\\\\nt^4 g' &= 3t\\\\\ng' &= \\frac{3}{t^3}\\\\\ng &= \\frac{-3}{2 t^2} + C_1.\n\\end{align*}\n\nAlso, from above,\n\n\\begin{align*}\nf' &= -t g' = \\frac{-3}{t^2}\\\\\nf &= \\frac{3}{t} + C_2.\n\\end{align*}\n\nHaving solve for f(t) and g(t) we get that the general solution to our\nproblem is\n\n\\[y = f(t) t^2 + g(t) t^3 = C_1 t^3 + C_2 t^2 + \\frac{3}{2} t.\\]"
