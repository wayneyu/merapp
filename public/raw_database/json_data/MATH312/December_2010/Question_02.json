        "Proceeding as stated in the hint, notice that the sum of the digits of\n\\emph{a} is\n\n$\\displaystyle (8+5)n = 13\\cdot3^{100}$\n\nand this is clearly divisible by 9. Thus \\emph{a} is divisible by 9.\nFurther, the alternating sum of the digits is\n\n$\\displaystyle (8-5)n = 3\\cdot3^{100}=3^{101}$\n\nand this is clearly not divisible by 11. Thus \\emph{a} is not divisible\nby 11."

        "Remember divisibility rules. A number is divisible by 9 if the sum of\nits digits is divisible by 9 and it is divisible by 11 if the\nalternating sum of its digits is divisible by 11."
