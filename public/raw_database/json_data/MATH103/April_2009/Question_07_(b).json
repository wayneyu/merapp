    "statement": "\\emph{Streptococcus viridans} bacteria divide along a preferred axis and\ntherefore form chains when they divide. You study a population of\n\\emph{S. viridans} in a blood culture. Let \\emph{X} be the length (in\n\u00c2\u00b5m) of a randomly chosen chain. Its distribution is described by the\nprobability density function\n\n\\[p(x) = \\frac1{x}, \\quad 1 \\leq x \\leq e\\]\n\nWhat is the probability of finding a chain of length at most 2\u00c2\u00b5m?\n\n$P\\{X\\leq 2\\}=$",
