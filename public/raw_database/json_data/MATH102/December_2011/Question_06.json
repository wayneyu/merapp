    "statement": "Let $f(x) = \\ln(x^{3})$ and $g(x) = (\\ln x)^{3}$. Find \\emph{all} values\nof \\emph{x} where the tangent lines of these two functions have the same\nslope (or show that no such values exist).",

        "First, we take derivatives and see that\n\n$\\displaystyle f'(x) = \\frac{1}{x^{3}}(3x^{2}) = \\frac{3}{x}$\n\n$\\displaystyle g'(x) = 3(\\ln(x))^{2}\\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{3(\\ln(x))^{2}}{x}$\n\nSetting the derivatives equal to each other gives\n\n$\\displaystyle \\frac{3}{x} = \\frac{3(\\ln(x))^{2}}{x}$\n\nwhich implies that\n\n$\\displaystyle (\\ln(x))^{2} = 1$\n\nHence, we have that $\\displaystyle \\ln(x) = 1$ or\n$\\displaystyle \\ln(x) = -1$. The first gives the solution\n$\\displaystyle x = e$ and the second gives $\\displaystyle x = e^{-1}$\nboth seen by exponentiating both sides. Both of these values are in the\ndomain of the original function and so this completes the proof."

        "Remember that tangent line slopes are just derivatives at points. So\ntake derivatives and set them equal."
