        "Let the line L be written in vector form as\n\n\\[\\displaystyle\n[a_{0},b_{0},c_{0}] + [a_{1},b_{1},b_{2}]t.\\] If L is parallel to the\nplane 2x + y - z = 5, then L must be perpendicular to the normal vector\nof said plane, n = {[}2,1,-1{]}. i.e. The dot product between n and the\ndirection of L must be equal to zero:\n\n\\[[2,1,-1]\\cdot[a_{1},b_{1},c_{1}] = 0.\\] Evaluating the dot product\ngives:\n\n\\[\\mathbf{(1)} \\quad [2,1,-1]\\cdot[a_{1},b_{1},c_{1}] = 2a_{1} + b_{1} - c_{1} = 0\\]\nRemember that we also need the vector is perpendicular to the\nline,$[3 - t, 1 - 2t, 3t] = [3,1,0] + [-1,-2,3]t.$ Hence, the following\nequation must also be satisfied:\n\n\\[\\displaystyle\n\\mathbf{(2)} \\quad [-1,-2,3] \\cdot [a_{1},b_{1},c_{1}] = -a_{1} - 2b_{1} + 3c_{1} = 0\\]\nSo we have two equations and three unknowns. This means there are\ninfinitely many vectors that will satisfy the given conditions. We only\nneed to find one. Solving (1) for $c_{1}$ gives\n$c_{1} = 2a_{1} + b_{1}$. Subbing this into (2) gives\n\n\\[\\displaystyle\n-a_{1} - 2b_{1} + 3(2a_{1} + b_{1}) = 0 \\quad \\rightarrow \\quad b_{1} = -5a_{1}.\\]\nFrom this we get that $c_{1} = 2a_{1} - 5a_{1} = -3a_{1}$.\n\nThus, any vector of the form k{[}1,-5,-3{]} where k is a constant (not\nequal to zero) will be parallel to L. For example, the vectors\n{[}1,-5,-3{]} and {[}-2,10,6{]} are acceptable solutions.\n\n(Note: Clearly $a_{1} = b_{1} = c_{1} = 0$ is a solution to the above\nequations (1), (2), but it is the trivial solution and is perpendicular\nto every vector, including the direction of the line L.)"
