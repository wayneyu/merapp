        "First we will solve for $\\displaystyle f'(x)$ using the chain rule on\nthe left and the product rule on the right.\n\n$\\frac{1}{f(x)} f'(x) = \\ln(x) + x \\frac1x$\n\n$\\displaystyle f'(x) = (\\ln(x) + 1)f(x)$\n\nIn order to complete the question, we must solve for $f(x)$ in terms of\n\\emph{x}. We will do this by using the equation\n\n\\[\\displaystyle\n\\ln(f(x)) = x\\ln(x)\\]\n\na second time, together with the log rule $a \\ln(b) = \\ln(b^a)$. So we\ncan rewrite the right side of the the equation above as:\n\n$\\displaystyle \\ln(f(x)) = \\ln(x^x)$\n\nApplying the exponential function to both sides causes the logarithm to\ndisappear, leaving:\n\n$e^{\\ln(f(x))} = e^{\\ln(x^x)}$\n\n$\\displaystyle f(x) = x^x$\n\nSubstituting this into our derivative, we arrive at the final answer:\n\n$\\displaystyle f'(x) = (\\ln(x) + 1)(x^x)$"
