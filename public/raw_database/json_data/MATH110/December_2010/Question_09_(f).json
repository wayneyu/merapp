Using parts (b)\nand (c) of the question, we know there are two asymptotes: x = 1 and y =\n1, and two intercepts: (0, -1) and (-1, 0).\n\n\\begin{figure}[htbp]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=.5\\textwidth]{Math_Exam_Resources_Courses_MATH110_December_2010Question_09_(f)Solution_1b.jpg}\n\\caption{Math Exam Resources Courses MATH110 December 2010Question 09 (f)Solution 1b.jpg}\n\\end{figure}\n\nFrom this picture, it is pretty clear to know where the left half of the\nfunction should go - it must pass through the two intercepts, is\ndecreasing, and goes towards the horizontal and vertical asymptotes.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htbp]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=.5\\textwidth]{Math_Exam_Resources_Courses_MATH110_December_2010Question_09_(f)Solution_1c.jpg}\n\\caption{Math Exam Resources Courses MATH110 December 2010Question 09 (f)Solution 1c.jpg}\n\\end{figure}\n\nThe right half of the function is a little trickier, but not by much. It\nmust either go in the upper-right or lower-right quadrant formed by the\ntwo asymptotes. However, in the lower quadrant, the function would have\nto be increasing. Thus it must be in the upper right quadrant,\ndecreasing from infinity and going towards 1.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htbp]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=.5\\textwidth]{Math_Exam_Resources_Courses_MATH110_December_2010Question_09_(f)Solution_1d.jpg}\n\\caption{Math Exam Resources Courses MATH110 December 2010Question 09 (f)Solution 1d.jpg}\n\\end{figure}"
