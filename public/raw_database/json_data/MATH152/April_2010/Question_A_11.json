        "To figure out the current on the current source E, we must choose which\ndirection we will cross the source. It shouldn't matter which direction\nwe take and so we will show both possibilities.\n\n\\textbf{Traverse the current source from bottom to top}:\n\nHere we are moving with current 2 ($+i_2$) and against current 1\n($-i_1$). E has a current of 9A in the upward direction (indicated by\nthe arrow). Since we are moving upwards then the current is +9A.\nTherefore,\n\n\\begin{align*}\\displaystyle{}i_2-i_1=9A.\\end{align*}\n\n\\textbf{Traverse the current source from bottom to top}:\n\nHere we are moving with current 1 ($+i_1$) and against current 2\n($-i_2$). E has a current of 9A in the upward direction (indicated by\nthe arrow). Since we are moving downward then the current is -9A.\nTherefore,\n\n\\begin{align*}\\displaystyle{}i_1-i_2=-9A.\\end{align*}\n\nNotice that these are the same equation as they should be.\n\n\\textbf{Full Solution for Those Interested:}\n\nIf people are looking to practice there work with circuits, we can\ncontinue work from here and from\n\\href{Science:Math_Exam_Resources/Courses/MATH152/April_2010/Question_A_10}{A10}\nto solve for the unknown voltages and loop currents. Based on the same\nreasoning in\n\\href{Science:Math_Exam_Resources/Courses/MATH152/April_2010/Question_A_10}{A10}\nwe can get that the Kirchhoff linear equation for loop 1 is\n\n\\begin{align*}\\displaystyle{}-6+i_1+v_1=0\\end{align*}\n\nwhere recall that positive numbers mean voltage drops (across the\nresistors and across the current source since it points upwards while\nour clockwise current points downwards there) and that negative numbers\nmean voltage gains (across the battery since we move from the negative\nto positive terminal). We already have the second loop from\n\\href{Science:Math_Exam_Resources/Courses/MATH152/April_2010/Question_A_10}{A10}\nas\n\n\\begin{align*}\\displaystyle{}2i_2+4(i_2-i_3)+7+3i_2-v_1=0\\end{align*}\n\nand so the third and final loop is\n\n\\begin{align*}\\displaystyle{}4(i_3-i_2)+5i_3+8=0\\end{align*}\n\nwhere the $4\\Omega$ resistor has a voltage drop since we're moving in\nthe direction of current loop 3 but a voltage gain from current loop 2.\n\nSo far we only have 3 equations for 4 unknowns; the last one comes from\nthe current source. From above we already have that\n\n\\begin{align*}\\displaystyle{}i_2-i_1=9.\\end{align*}\n\nWe can write this in a matrix problem as\n\n\\begin{align*}\\begin{bmatrix}\n1  &  0  &  0  &  1\\\\\n0  &  9  &  -4  &  -1\\\\\n0  &  -4  &  9  &  0\\\\\n-1  &  1  &  0  &  0\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\begin{bmatrix}\ni_1\\\\\ni_2\\\\\ni_3\\\\\nv_1\n\\end{bmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n6\\\\\n-7\\\\\n-8\\\\\n9\n\\end{bmatrix}.\\end{align*}\n\nWe can write this is an augmented matrix as\n\n\\begin{align*}\\left[\\begin{array}{cccc|c}\n1  &  0  &  0  &  1 & 6\\\\\n0  &  9  &  -4  &  -1 & -7\\\\\n0  &  -4  &  9  &  0 & -8\\\\\n-1  &  1  &  0  &  0 & 9\n\\end{array}\\right]\\end{align*}\n\nwhich we can row reduce to get\n\n\\begin{align*}\\left[\\begin{array}{cccc|c}\n1  &  0  &  0  &  0  &  -8.4595\\\\\n0  &  1  &  0  &  0  &  0.5405\\\\\n0  &  0  &  1  &  0  &  -0.6486\\\\\n0  &  0  &  0  &  1  &  14.4595\\\\\n\\end{array}\\right].\\end{align*}\n\nTherefore we see that our solution is\n\n\\begin{align*}\\begin{bmatrix}\ni_1\\\\\ni_2\\\\\ni_3\\\\\nv_1\\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n -8.4595\\\\\n  0.5405\\\\\n  -0.6486\\\\\n  14.4595\n\\end{bmatrix}.\\end{align*}\n\nDo not worry about the presence of a negative sign, a negative loop\ncurrent just means that the current ($i_1$ and $i_3$ in this case)\nactually flows counter-clockwise, not clockwise like we assumed."
