    "statement": "Oceanographers on research ships use a device called a \\emph{CTD probe}\nto make underwater measurements at extreme depths. The probe drops\nvertically through the water at 4 m/s. Simultaneously, the research ship\nmoves away from the drop site at 5 m/s. What is the rate of change of\nthe distance between the probe and the ship 10 seconds after the probe\nis dropped?",

        "Let $x$ be the distance of the ship from the drop point, $y$ be the\ndistance of the probe from the drop point, and $r$ be the distance\nbetween the ship and the probe. Drawing a labelled picture looks like\nthis:\n\n\\begin{figure}[htbp]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=.5\\textwidth]{ScienceMathExamResourcesMath110April20128.jpg}\n\\caption{ScienceMathExamResourcesMath110April20128.jpg}\n\\end{figure}\n\nWe want to find $\\frac{dr}{dt}$, at time 10s after the probe is dropped.\nWe know that $\\frac{dx}{dt} = 5 m/s$ and $\\frac{dy}{dt} = 4 m/s$.\n\nBy the Pythagorean Theorem,\n\n\\[x^2 + y^2 = r^2.\\]\n\nIn order to find the relationship between the time rates of change of\nthese variables, we differentiate both sides of this equation with\nrespect to time, in order to obtain\n\n\\[2x \\frac{dx}{dt}+2y \\frac{dy}{dt} = 2r\\frac{dr}{dt}\\]\n\nDividing both sides by $2r$ in order to isolate $\\frac{dr}{dt}$, we find\n\n\\[\\frac{dr}{dt} =\\frac{x \\frac{dx}{dt}+y \\frac{dy}{dt}}{r}.\\]\n\nWe are interested in the value of $\\frac{dr}{dt}$, at time $10s$ after\nthe probe is dropped. At this point in time,\n\n\\[x= 5 m/s \\cdot 10s = 50 m,\\]\n\n\\[y= 4 m/s\\cdot 10s = 40 m,\\] and\n\n\\begin{align*}\nr &= \\sqrt{x^2+y^2} = \\sqrt{(50m)^2+(40m)^2} \\\\\n&= 10\\sqrt{5^2+4^2} \\ m = 10\\sqrt{41} \\ m.\n\\end{align*}\n\nHence,\n\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{dr}{dt} &= \\frac{(50 m) (5 m/s)+(40 m)(4m/s) }{10\\sqrt{41}m} \\\\\n&=\\frac{25m/s+16m/s}{\\sqrt{41}} \\\\\n&= \\sqrt{41} \\ m/s  .\n\\end{align*}\n\nThat is, $10s$ after the probe is dropped, the distance between the\nprobe and ship is increasing at a rate of $\\sqrt{41} \\ m/s$."
