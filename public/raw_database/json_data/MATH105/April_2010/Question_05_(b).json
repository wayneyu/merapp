        "From\n\\href{Science:Math Exam Resources/Courses/MATH105/April 2010/Question 5 (a)}{part\n(a)}, we have\n\n\\begin{align*}\\frac{dy}{dt} = 0.05y - A,\\end{align*}\n\nwhich we will solve by separation of variables. Knowing the solution\nwill allow us to give a condition on $A$ so that after 25 years, the\nbalance owed is zero.\n\nWe notice that the equation is separable and rearrange to find\n\n\\begin{align*}\\frac{dy}{0.05y - A} = dt.\\end{align*}\n\nNow we integrate to get\n\n\\begin{align*}\\int \\frac{dy}{0.05y - A} = 20 \\ln |0.05 y - A| = t + C.\\end{align*}\n\nTherefore,\n\n\\begin{align*}\n\\ln|0.05y - A| &= t/20 + C/20\\\\\n|0.05y - A| &= e^{t/20+C/20} = e^{C/20}e^{t/20}\\\\\n0.05y - A &= F e^{t/20}\\end{align*}\n\nwhere $F$ is an arbitrary constant that comes out of the integration,\n\n\\begin{align*}\\displaystyle\n\\pm e^{C/20}\\end{align*}\n\nin this case.\n\nAfter one last rearrangement, we see that the amount of money owed after\n$t$ years is\n\n\\begin{align*}\\displaystyle{}y(t) = 20A + 20Fe^{t/20}\\end{align*}\n\nor\n\n\\begin{align*}\\displaystyle{}y(t) = 20A + Ge^{20t}\\end{align*}\n\nfor another arbitary constant $G$.\n\nFrom the initial condition, $y(0) = 240 000$ so $20A + G = 240 000$ or\n$G = 240,000-20A$. Finally then our full equation for the amount of\nmoney owing, $y(t)$ is,\n\n\\begin{align*}\\displaystyle{}y(t) = (240000-20A)e^{t/20} + 20A.\\end{align*}\n\nSetting $y(25) = 0$ (which corresponds to having no money owing after 25\nyears) forces\n\n\\begin{align*}\\displaystyle{}(240000-20A)e^{25/20} + 20A = 0\\end{align*}\n\nso\n\n\\begin{align*}A = \\frac{240000e^{25/20}}{20(e^{25/20}-1)} = \\frac{12000e^{5/4}}{e^{5/4}-1}=16818.61.\\end{align*}\n\nTherefore, the annual payments are $A$ = \\$16818.61.", 
        "From\n\\href{Science:Math Exam Resources/Courses/MATH105/April 2010/Question 5 (a)}{part\n(a)} we have that\n\n\\begin{align*}\\frac{\\textrm{d}y}{\\textrm{d}t}=0.05y(t)-A\\end{align*}\n\nwith the initial amount of money owed being $y(0)=240 000$. The goal is\nto solve this equation for the rate of $y$ so that we can actually\nobtain the quantity we want, $y(t)$ which is the money owed after $t$\nyears. Consider the substitution,\n\n\\begin{align*}\\displaystyle{}u(t)=0.05y-A\\end{align*}\n\nwhich implies that\n\n\\begin{align*}\\frac{\\textrm{d}u}{\\textrm{d}t}=0.05\\frac{\\textrm{d}y}{\\textrm{d}t}.\\end{align*}\n\nTherefore we can rewrite (and simplify) our differential equation as\n\n\\begin{align*}\\frac{\\textrm{d}u}{\\textrm{d}t}=ru\\end{align*}\n\nwhich we recognize as the exponential model and so we know the solution\nis\n\n\\begin{align*}\\displaystyle{}u(t)=B\\exp(0.05t)\\end{align*}\n\nwith $B$ an arbitrary constant. This solution can also be determined\nfrom separation of variables and integration. Putting back into our\noriginal variable, $y(t)$, we get\n\n\\begin{align*}y(t)=\\frac{B\\exp(0.05t)+A}{0.05}.\\end{align*}\n\nwhich is our desired equation for the amount owed on the mortgage after\ntime $t$. Using the initial condition\n\n\\begin{align*}y(0)=\\frac{B+A}{0.05}=240 000\\end{align*}\n\nwe get that $B=12000-A$. Therefore we are able to write the amount of\nmoney owed solely in terms of the annual payments, $A$,\n\n\\begin{align*}y(t)=\\frac{(12000-A)\\exp(0.05t)+A}{0.05}.\\end{align*}\n\nNow when $t=25$, we want that the mortgage is paid off, i.e., we want\nthe amount of money we owe to be zero. Therefore we seek that $y(25)=0$.\nTherefore,\n\n\\begin{align*}\n0&=\\frac{(12000-A)\\exp(0.05 \\cdot 25)}{0.05}\\\\\nA&=\\frac{12000\\exp(0.05 \\cdot 25)}{\\exp(0.05 \\cdot 25)-1}=16818.61.\\end{align*}\n\nTherefore, in order to pay off the mortgage in 25 years, we require that\n$A$ = 16818.61. Recall that when we started paying the mortgage at year\nzero we owed 80\\% of the value or 240 000 dollars. If we want to find\nout how much we really paid, we just need to multiply our annual rate,\n$A$ by 25 years to get \\$420 465.25. Add this to the \\$60 000 we already\npaid up front then our \\$300 000 dollar house has actually cost us \\$480\n465.25!"
