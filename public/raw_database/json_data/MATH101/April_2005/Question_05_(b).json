    "statement": "A water tank with depth 3 feet is in the shape of the trough depicted\nbelow. The bottom edge of the tank is 1 foot above the ground, and the\nends of the tank are equilateral triangles of side length $2\\sqrt{3}$\nfeet; the top of the tank is a rectangle of length 12 feet and width\n$2\\sqrt{3}$ feet.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htbp]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=.5\\textwidth]{Math_Exam_Resources_Courses_MATH101_April_2005_Question_5_(a)_picture1.png}\n\\caption{Math\\_Exam\\_Resources\\_Courses\\_MATH101\\_April\\_2005\\_Question\\_5\\_(a)\\_picture1.png}\n\\end{figure}\n\n(b) Sometime after it is filled, the tank develops a small hole at its\nbottom. The tank then drains according to Toricelli's Law:\n\n\\begin{align*}A(y)\\frac{dy}{dt} = -k\\sqrt{y},\\end{align*}\n\nwhere $y$ is the height of the water in the tank above its bottom,\n$A(y)$ is the area of the horizontal cross-section of the tank at height\n$y$, and $k$ is a positive constant. If the water level in the tank\ndrops to 1 foot after 2 hours, how long will it take for the tank to\nempty?\n\n(Do not simplify you answer.)",

        "We proceed as in part (a). Here though we will make the bottom of the\ntrough our origin. Letting $l(y)$ be the length of hte regtangle at\nheight \\emph{y}, we see that\n\n$\\displaystyle \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3} = \\frac{l(y)/2}{y}$\n\nand solving gives\n\n$\\displaystyle l(y) = \\frac{2y\\sqrt{3}}{3}$.\n\nNext, since the width of the rectangle is fixed and given in the\nquestion, we see that\n\n$\\displaystyle A(y) = (12)l(y) = 8\\sqrt{3}y$\n\nUsing Torcelli's law, we have\n\n\\begin{align*}\n8\\sqrt{3}y\\frac{dy}{dt} &=  -k\\sqrt{y} \\\\\n\\int 8\\sqrt{3}\\sqrt{y}\\,dy &= \\int -k\\,dt \\\\\n\\frac{16\\sqrt{3}y^{3/2}}{3} &= -kt + C\\end{align*}\n\nfor some constant \\emph{C}. Since $y(0) = 3$ (the trough started full),\nwe have\n\n$\\displaystyle C = -k(0) + C = \\frac{16\\sqrt{3}y(0)^{3/2}}{3} = \\frac{16\\sqrt{3}^{4}}{3} = 48$\n\nUsing $y(2) = 1$, we have\n\n$\\displaystyle C - 2k = 48-2k = \\frac{16\\sqrt{3}(y(2))^{3/2}}{3} = \\frac{16\\sqrt{3}}{3}$\n\nand thus\n\n$\\displaystyle k = 24 - \\frac{8\\sqrt{3}}{3}$\n\nHere is a good sanity check spot. Notice that \\emph{k} is positive which\nis good since the question told us this.\n\nNow, we are looking for the value of \\emph{t} where $y(t)=0$ and so, we\nwith to find the \\emph{t} value where\n\n$\\displaystyle 0 = \\frac{16\\sqrt{3}y(t)^{3/2}}{3} = -kt + C$\n\nand hence we want the value where $\\displaystyle t = C/k$. Plugging in\nthe values above gives\n\n$\\displaystyle t = \\frac{C}{K} = \\frac{48}{ 24 - \\frac{8\\sqrt{3}}{3}} = \\frac{48(3)}{72-8\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{18}{9-\\sqrt{3}}$\n\nas required. Another good sanity check, notice that this number is\nbigger than 2 which is good since at 2 we had that the depth was 1\nmetre."
