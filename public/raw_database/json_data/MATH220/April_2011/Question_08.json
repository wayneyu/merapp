        "\\textbf{For (a):} First we can rewrite this statement without the\nsymbols in slightly more meaningful English.\n\n\\begin{description}\n\\itemsep1pt\\parskip0pt\\parsep0pt\n\\item[]\n\\emph{For any prime number \\textbf{m} and for any prime number\n\\textbf{n}, \\textbf{m}+\\textbf{n} is prime.}\n\\end{description}\n\nThis is clear false since adding two primes doesn't always give a prime,\nfor example 3+5=8.\n\n\\textbf{For (b):} we get\n\n\\begin{description}\n\\itemsep1pt\\parskip0pt\\parsep0pt\n\\item[]\n\\emph{for any prime \\textbf{m} there exists a prime \\textbf{n} such that\n\\textbf{m}+\\textbf{n} is prime.}\n\\end{description}\n\nFor this to be true, it has to be true for any choice of prime\n\\textbf{m}. Consider for example \\textbf{m}=7. Can we add a prime to\nthat number so that the sum is prime as well? There are two types of\nprimes: the even ones (actually, 2 is the only even prime) and the odd\nones. If we add 2 to 7, we get 9 which isn't prime, so that doesn't\nwork. If we add any odd number to 7, we get an even number (clearly not\n2) so clearly not a prime either. So no prime can be added to 7 to make\nit prime and hence the statement \\emph{(b)} is false.\n\n\\textbf{For (c):} we get\n\n\\begin{description}\n\\itemsep1pt\\parskip0pt\\parsep0pt\n\\item[]\n\\emph{There exists a prime \\textbf{m} such that for any prime \\textbf{n}\nwe have \\textbf{m}+\\textbf{n} is prime as well.}\n\\end{description}\n\nThis is fairly similar to the statement \\emph{(b)} except that here we\nwant to be able to always add the same prime to any prime to get a new\none. In other words, it is even harder to make this statement true and\nhence it is false. Indeed, we showed above that no prime can be added to\n7 to make it prime again, so here 7 is a case of a value of \\textbf{n}\nfor which we show that no prime \\textbf{m} would do the trick.\n\n\\textbf{For (d):} we get\n\n\\begin{description}\n\\itemsep1pt\\parskip0pt\\parsep0pt\n\\item[]\n\\emph{There exists a prime \\textbf{m} and there exists a prime\n\\textbf{n} such that \\textbf{m}+\\textbf{n} is prime.}\n\\end{description}\n\nThis sounds much more reasonable and it is. This statement is true since\nwe can actually even show values of \\textbf{m} and \\textbf{n} that work.\nConsider for example \\textbf{m}=2 and \\textbf{n} = 3. Then\n\\textbf{m}+\\textbf{n}=5 which is prime. So such values exist and so\nstatement \\emph{(d)} is true.\n\n\\textbf{Note:} actually in \\emph{(d)}, you should easily convince\nyourself that one of the prime has to be 2 and so the other has to be\nwhat is called a \\href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin_prime}{twin\nprime}, that is, a prime with the property that if you add 2 to it it is\nprime as well (those are, except for 2 and 3, the closest primes you\nmight get and that's why we call them twin primes). For example, 5 and 7\nare twin primes and so are 11 and 13; 17 and 19; 29 and 31. We do not\nknow if there are infinitely many twin primes but we suppose it is the\ncase (this is what we call the The\n\\href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin_prime}{twin prime conjecture})."
