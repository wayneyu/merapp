        "In the first part of the question, we calculated the row reduced form of\nthe augmented matrix of the system and obtained:\n\n\\begin{align*}\\left[ \\begin{array}{cccc}\n1 & 2 & 3 & 1 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 1 & -1 \\\\\n0 & 0 & t & -1\n\\end{array} \\right]\\end{align*} For which we saw that unless \\emph{t} = 0, there\nis always a unique solution (since the matrix has full rank in that\ncase).\n\nThe third row of the matrix translates into\n\n\\begin{align*}\\displaystyle\ntx_3 = -1\\end{align*} Which is equivalent to\n\n\\begin{align*}x_3 = -\\frac{1}{t}\\end{align*} (recall that we suppose here that \\emph{t} is NOT\nequal to 0.)\n\nThe second row gives\n\n\\begin{align*}\\displaystyle\nx_2 +x_3 = -1\\end{align*} and so\n\n\\begin{align*}\\displaystyle\nx_2 -\\frac{1}{t} = -1\\end{align*} which gives\n\n\\begin{align*}\\displaystyle\nx_2 = -1 +\\frac{1}{t} = \\frac{1-t}{t}\\end{align*}\n\nAnd finally, the first row gives\n\n\\begin{align*}\\displaystyle\nx_1 + 2x_2 + 3x_3 = 1\\end{align*} Substituting for \\emph{x}\\textsubscript{2} and\n\\emph{x}\\textsubscript{3} we obtain\n\n\\begin{align*}\\displaystyle\nx_1 + \\frac{2(1-t)}{t} - \\frac{3}{t} = 1\\end{align*} And hence\n\n\\begin{align*}\\displaystyle\nx_1 = \\frac{t-2(1-t)+3}{t} = \\frac{3t+1}{t}\\end{align*}\n\nAnd we obtain that the system has a unique solution (when \\emph{t} is\nnot zero) which depends on \\emph{t} and the solution is\n\n\\begin{align*}\\left[ \\begin{array}{c}\nx_1 \\\\\n\\\\\nx_2 \\\\\n\\\\\nx_3\n\\end{array} \\right] = \\left[ \\begin{array}{c}\n\\frac{3t+1}{t} \\\\\n\\\\\n\\frac{1-t}{t} \\\\\n\\\\\n-\\frac{1}{t}\n\\end{array} \\right]\\end{align*}"

        "You can determine the solution of a system from its row-reduced form.\nParametric just means you keep carrying the variable \\emph{t}, so your\nsolution is a general formula that gives the solution of the system in\nterms of \\emph{t}."
