    "statement": "The population of fish in a particular lake is given by the function\n\\emph{F(t)} where \\emph{F} is measured in number of fish and \\emph{t} is\nmeasured in days. A company that manages fish stocks is hired to restock\nthe lake, adding fish at a constant rate. Only \\emph{N} fishers are\nallowed to fish in the lake at a time. A simple model for this scenario\nis given by the equation:\n\n$\\frac{dF}{dt} = I - \\alpha N F$\n\nWhere \\emph{I} and $\\alpha$ are constant and two cases for \\emph{N} are\nconsidered.\n\nCase 1: Suppose \\emph{N} is a constant. What is the steady state number\nof fish $(F_*)$ in the lake? If the lake has no fish in it initially, at\nwhat time $(t_*)$ does the population size reach half its steady state\nvalue $F_*/2$? (You do not have to show a derivation of the solution\n\\emph{F(t)} of the equation for full points - simply stating it is\nsufficient - but you must show the rest of the calculation.)",
