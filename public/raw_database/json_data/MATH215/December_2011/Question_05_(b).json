        "Given that in\n\\href{Science:Math_Exam_Resources/Courses/MATH215/December_2011/Question_5_(a)}{part\n(a)} of this problem we were asked to compute the Laplace transform of\nf(t), it stands to reason that using Laplace transforms will be a good\nway to solve this problem. We begin by taking the Laplace transform of\nthe entire differential equation. We can do this because the Laplace\nTransform is a \\textbf{linear operator}, i.e.\n\n\\[\\mathcal{L}(af(t)+bg(t))=a\\mathcal{L}(f(t))+b\\mathcal{L}(g(t)).\\]\n\nTaking the Laplace transform, we get\n\n\\[\\mathcal{L}(y'')-5\\mathcal{L}(y')+6\\mathcal{L}(y)=\\mathcal{L}(f(t)).\\]\n\nDefine the following\n\n\\begin{align*}\nF(s)&=\\mathcal{L}(f(t))\\\\\nY(s)&=\\mathcal{L}(y(t)).\n\\end{align*}\n\nFrom\n\\href{Science:Math_Exam_Resources/Courses/MATH215/December_2011/Question_5_(a)}{part\n(a)}, we have that\n\n\\[F(s)=\\frac{\\pi}{s}\\left(2\\exp(-s)-\\exp(-2s)\\right).\\]\n\nIf we look at the table at the back of the exam we can retrieve the\nLaplace transforms for derivatives (of course we could also compute\nthese if we needed to). We see that the general rule for the Laplace\ntransform of the nth derivative of a function, g(t) is\n\n\\[\\mathcal{L}(g^{(n)}(t))=s^nG(s)-s^{n-1}g(0)-\\dots-g^{(n-1)}(0)\\]\n\nand therefore we can write\n\n\\begin{align*}\n\\mathcal{L}(y')&=sY(s)-y(0)=sY-1\\\\\n\\mathcal{L}(y'')&=s^2Y(s)-sy(0)-y'(0)=s^2Y-s\n\\end{align*}\n\nwhere we have used that $\\displaystyle {}y(0)=1$ and\n$\\displaystyle {}y'(0)=0$ as given in the question. Substituting these\nexpressions into the original differential equation we get,\n\n\\[\\displaystyle{}s^2Y(s)-s-5(sY(s)-1)+6Y=F(s).\\]\n\nSimplifying this expression we get\n\n\\[\\displaystyle{}(s^2-5s+6)Y(s)=F(s)+s-5\\]\n\nwhich we can solve for Y(s)to get\n\n\\[Y(s)=\\frac{F(s)-4s}{(s-3)(s-2)}=\\frac{F(s)}{(s-3)(s-2)}+\\frac{s-5}{(s-3)(s-2)}\\]\n\nwhere we have factored the quadratic. While it may look like we have\nsolved the problem, we need to present the solution in terms of y(t),\nthe original function. To do this we need to compute the inverse Laplace\ntransform of Y(s). While we could attempt to do this manually using the\nformula for inverse Laplace transforms, we should attempt to put it in a\nform where we can use the chart at the end of the exam. Once again, the\ninverse Laplace transform is a linear operator so we have\n\n\\[y(t)=\\mathcal{L}^{-1}(Y(s))=\\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\left(\\frac{F(s)}{(s-3)(s-2)}\\right)+\\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\left(\\frac{s-5}{(s-3)(s-2)}\\right)\\]\n\nand we can compute these two quantities separately. We will start with\nthe second inverse Laplace transform. Looking at our chart at the end of\nthe exam we see an inverse Laplace transform for functions of the form\n\n\\[\\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\left(\\frac{1}{s-a}\\right)=\\exp(at).\\]\n\nHowever, our problem has a product of linear terms in the denominator\nand this suggests that we split our problem up using\n\\href{:Category:MER_Tag_Partial_fractions}{partial fraction\ndecomposition}. Doing this we get\n\n\\[\\frac{s-5}{(s-3)(s-2)}=\\frac{3}{(s-2)}-\\frac{2}{(s-3)}.\\]\n\nWe now have this in a form where we can apply the inverse Laplace\ntransform but we will do that at the end. We now focus on the first\nterm,\n\n\\[\\frac{F(s)}{(s-3)(s-2)}=\\frac{\\frac{\\pi}{s}\\left(2\\exp(-s)-\\exp(-2s)\\right)}{(s-3)(s-2)}.\\]\n\nNow there are several ways we can proceed. One way is to consider\n\n\\[G(s)=\\frac{1}{(s-3)(s-2)}\\]\n\nand then our term looks like F(s)G(s). We could then invert this using\nthe convolution identity\n\n\\[\\mathcal{L}^{-1}(F(s)G(s))=\\int_0^tf(t-\\tau)g(t)dt.\\]\n\nWhile this is valid, it could lead to confusion since f(t) is piecewise\ndefined and so we would have to be careful about the different cases\nthat come out of the integration. Another way we can do the inversion is\nto include the 1/s terms in F(s) along with the other linear terms in\nthe denominator of G(s). In this way we write\n\n\\[\\frac{F(s)}{(s-3)(s-2)}=\\frac{\\pi\\left(2\\exp(-s)-\\exp(-2s)\\right)}{s(s-3)(s-2)}=2\\pi\\exp(-s)G(s)-\\pi\\exp(-2s)G(s)\\]\n\nwhere we now define\n\n\\[G(s)=\\frac{1}{s(s-3)(s-2)}.\\]\n\nThe advantage of this form is that the table at the end of the exam\nlists\n\n\\[\\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\left(\\exp(-cs)F(s)\\right)=u_c(t)f(t-c)\\]\n\nwhere u\\_c is the Heaviside function defined as\n\n\\[u_c=\n\\begin{cases}\n0,&t<c\\\\\n1,&t\\geq{}c\n\\end{cases}.\\]\n\nWe can use this identity if we once again write G(s) using partial\nfraction decomposition. Doing this we get\n\n\\[G(s)=\\frac{1}{s(s-3)(s-2)}=\\frac{1}{6s}+\\frac{1}{3(s-3)}-\\frac{1}{2(s-2)}.\\]\n\nWe can now return to the full problem and actually compute the various\ninverse Laplace transforms using these identities.\n\n\\begin{align*}\ny(t)=\\mathcal{L}^{-1}(Y(s))&=\\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\left(\\frac{F(s)}{(s-3)(s-2)}\\right)+\\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\left(\\frac{s-5}{(s-3)(s-2)}\\right)\\\\\n&=2\\pi\\mathcal{L}^{-1}(\\exp(-s)G(s))-\\pi\\mathcal{L}^{-1}(\\exp(-2s)G(s))+3\\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\left(\\frac{1}{s-2}\\right)-2\\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\left(\\frac{1}{s-3}\\right)\\\\\n&=2\\pi{}u_1g(t-1)-\\pi{}u_2g(t-2)+3\\exp(2t)-2\\exp(3t)\n\\end{align*}\n\nwhere\n\n\\[g(t)=\\mathcal{L}^{-1}G(s)=\\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\left(\\frac{1}{6s}+\\frac{1}{3(s-3)}-\\frac{1}{2(s-2)}\\right)=\\frac{1}{6}+\\frac{1}{3}\\exp(3t)-\\frac{1}{2}\\exp(2t).\\]\n\n\\textbf{Notes:}\n\nHad we decided to use the convolution identity we would get the same\nresults, we would just have to either explicitly write down the\ndifferent cases or we would need to independently identify the different\nHeaviside functions that are appearing.\n\nThere are two handy things we can confirm to at least give us some\nconfidence in our solution. Firstly, if we substitute in t=0 then we can\neasily see that both of the initial conditions are satisfied. Secondly,\nif t\\textless{}1 then the source term f(t) contributes nothing and so we\nhave\n\n\\[\\displaystyle{}y(t)=3\\exp(2t)-2\\exp(3t)\\]\n\nwhich we can verify, by direct substitution or otherwise, solves the\nhomogeneous problem.\n\nFinally, if reading the Heaviside notation is awkward, we present the\nfinal solution in terms of cases:\n\n\\[y(t)=\n\\begin{cases}\n3\\exp(2t)-2\\exp(3t),&t<1\\\\\n\\frac{\\pi}{3}+\\frac{2\\pi}{3}\\exp(3(t-1))-\\pi\\exp(2(t-1))+3\\exp(2t)-2\\exp(3t),&1\\leq{}t<2\\\\\n\\frac{\\pi}{6}+\\frac{2\\pi}{3}\\exp(3(t-1))-\\pi\\exp(2(t-1))-\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\exp(3(t-2))+\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\exp(2(t-2))+3\\exp(2t)-2\\exp(3t),&t\\geq{}2\n\\end{cases}.\\]"
