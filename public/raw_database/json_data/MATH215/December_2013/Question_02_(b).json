        "As the ODE is separable, we can re-express with the differentials\nseparated:\n\n\\[\\displaystyle\n(x^2+1) dx = (t^2+1) dt\\] which can be integrated to yield\n\n\\[\\int (x^2+1) dx = \\frac{x^3}{3} + x = \\int (t^2+1) dt = \\frac{t^3}{3} + t + C\\]\n\nWe merge the two integration constants to \\emph{C}. From our initial\ncondition that $x(0) = -1$ we obtain\n\n\\[\\displaystyle \\frac{(-1)^3}{3} - 1 = \\frac{0^3}{3} + 0 + C\\]\n\nand hence \\emph{C = -4/3}. Left in implicit form the solution reads\n\n\\[\\frac{x^3}{3} + x = \\frac{t^3}{3} + t - \\frac{4}{3}\\]"
