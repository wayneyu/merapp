Find the lengths \\emph{a} and\n\\emph{b} for which the area A of the triangle is maximized. You must\nalso check that you found a maximum and your solution must include that\ncheck. \\emph{Hint:} Heron's formula may be useful which states that\n\n\\[A^{2} = s(s - x)(s - y)(s - z)\\] where \\emph{A} is the area of the\ntriangle, \\emph{x}, \\emph{y}, \\emph{z} are its side lengths and \\emph{s\n= (x+y+z)/2}.\n\n\\begin{description}\n\\itemsep1pt\\parskip0pt\\parsep0pt\n\\item[]\n\\includegraphics[width=.5\\textwidth]{MATH102_2011_9.png}\n\\end{description}",

        "First, using Heron's formula, we have that the semiperimeter is\n$\\displaystyle s = 1$ and so\n\n$\\displaystyle A^{2} = (1-a)(1-a)(1-b)$.\n\nNext, the perimeter is given by $\\displaystyle 2 = 2a + b$ and so\n$\\displaystyle b = 2-a$. Substituting this into the area formula, we\nhave\n\n$\\displaystyle A^{2} = (1-a)^{2}(1-(2-2a)) = (1-a)^{2}(2a-1)$\n\nTaking the derivative implicitly with respect to \\emph{a} via the chain\nrule and product rule, we have\n\n\\begin{align*}\n 2AA' &= (2(1-a)(-1))(2a-1) + (1-a)^{2}(2) \\\\\n&= -2(1-a)(2a-1) + 2(1-a)^{2} \\\\\n&= 2(1-a)(-(2a-1) + (1-a)) \\\\\n&= -2(1-a)(3a-2) \n\\end{align*}\n\nSetting the derivative to 0 and optimizing gives \\emph{a}=1 and \\emph{a}\n= 2/3. Now, looking at the Perimeter restraint\n\n$\\displaystyle 2 = 2a + b$\n\nWe see that the maximum either occurs when \\emph{a}=0, \\emph{a}=1 (and\nso \\emph{b}=0, these last two values are the endpoints since side\nlengths are non-negative) or when \\emph{a}=2/3. At the first two values,\nthe area is 0 and so at \\emph{a}=2/3 is where the maximum will be. Thus,\n\n$\\displaystyle A(2/3) = \\sqrt{(1-(2/3))^{2}(2(2/3)-1)} = \\sqrt{(1/9)(1/3)} = \\frac{1}{3\\sqrt{3}}$\n\ncompleting the proof."
