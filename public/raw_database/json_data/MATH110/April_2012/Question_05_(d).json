        "To find the vertical asymptotes, we will take the limit of the function\nat both \\emph{x = -1} and \\emph{x = 1}.\n\n\\begin{align*}\\lim_{x \\to -1} f(x) = \\lim_{x \\to -1} \\frac{2x^2}{x^2 - 1}\\end{align*}\n\nThis limit is undefined since the denominator goes to zero but the\nnumerator is nonzero. We will try taking the left and right hand limit\nat \\emph{x = -1}\n\n\\begin{align*}\\lim_{x \\to -1^-} \\frac{2x^2}{x^2 - 1} = \\lim_{x \\to -1^-} \\frac{2x^2}{(x + 1)(x - 1)} = \\infty\\end{align*}\n\nNote that as \\emph{x} approaches -1 from the left, the numerator of the\nfraction will be positive. Both terms in the denominator will be\nnegative, yielding an overall positive number. As the denominator is\ndecreasing, this is the same as saying that the entire fraction is\nincreasing. Thus the limit is positive infinity. Using similar reasoning\nwe can solve the right hand limit to get\n\n\\begin{align*}\\lim_{x \\to -1^+} \\frac{2x^2}{x^2 - 1} = -\\infty\\end{align*}\n\nTaking the limit at \\emph{x = 1} will give us an undefined limit in the\nsame way as before. Checking right and left hand limits gives\n\n\\begin{align*}\\lim_{x \\to 1^-} \\frac{2x^2}{x^2 - 1} = -\\infty\\end{align*}\n\n\\begin{align*}\\lim_{x \\to 1^+} \\frac{2x^2}{x^2 - 1} = \\infty\\end{align*}\n\nThus we have vertical asymptotes at \\emph{x = -1} and \\emph{x = 1},\nwhere the value of the function near the asymptote depends which side of\nthe asymptote it is approaching."

        "We check for vertical asymptotes by taking the limit of the function at\npoints where it is undefined or otherwise not continuous.
