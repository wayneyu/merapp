        "Our function we are considering is $\\displaystyle f(x) = x^{1/3}$.\nTaking derivatives gives\n\n$\\displaystyle f'(x) = x^{-2/3}/3$\n\n$\\displaystyle f''(x) = -2x^{-5/3}/9$\n\nOn the interval of length 1 around the point 8, we see that the maximum\nvalue on the second derivative of the absolute value of the double\nderivative is given by\n\n$\\displaystyle |f''(x)| = |-2x^{-5/3}/9| \\leq 2x^{-5/3}/9 \\leq 2\\cdot7^{-5/3}/9$\n\ntrue since the function $\\displaystyle x^{-5/3}$ is a decreasing\nfunction. Thus, the absolute value of hte error is bounded by\n\n$\\displaystyle 2\\cdot7^{-5/3}/18 \\cdot (9-8)^{2} = 2\\cdot7^{-5/3}/18$"
