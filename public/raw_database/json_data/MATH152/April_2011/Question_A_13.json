        "As per the hint, we only have to consider the transformation of 4\nspecial points. These points are the corners of the square. Linear\ntransformations cannot distort the edges of a figure in such a way that\nthey split an edge into a new corner. Therefore, the transformed figure\nmust have the same amount of corners as the original figure. Because of\nthis, it is easiest to just transform the corners and then connect them\nto make the new figure. Our transformation matrix is\n\n\\[A=\\begin{bmatrix}\n1  &  2\\\\\n2  &  1\n\\end{bmatrix}\\]\n\nand the four corners of the square are {[}0,0{]}, {[}1,0{]}, {[}0,1{]},\nand {[}1,1{]}. Firstly notice that the origin will always map to itself\nbecause no matrix can multiply {[}0,0{]} to produce anything but\n{[}0,0{]}. Therefore, we really only have to transform 3 points. The\ntransformation of {[}1,0{]} is,\n\n\\[A\\begin{bmatrix}1\\\\0\\end{bmatrix}=\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1  &  2\\\\\n2  &  1\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1\\\\\n0\n\\end{bmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1\\\\\n2\n\\end{bmatrix}.\\]\n\nThe transformation of {[}0,1{]} is,\n\n\\[A\\begin{bmatrix}0\\\\1\\end{bmatrix}=\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1  &  2\\\\\n2  &  1\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n0\\\\\n1\n\\end{bmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n2\\\\\n1\n\\end{bmatrix}\\]\n\nand the transformation of {[}1,1{]} is\n\n\\[A\\begin{bmatrix}1\\\\1\\end{bmatrix}=\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1  &  2\\\\\n2  &  1\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1\\\\\n1\n\\end{bmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n3\\\\\n3\n\\end{bmatrix}.\\]\n\nTherefore we have ${\\color{blue}[0,0]}$ transforms to\n${\\color{red}[0,0]}$, ${\\color{blue}[1,0]}$ transforms to\n${\\color{red}[1,2]}$, ${\\color{blue}[0,1]}$ transforms to\n${\\color{red}[2,1]}$ and ${\\color{blue}[1,1]}$ transforms to\n${\\color{red}[3,3]}$. The plot to the right\n\\href{file:152Apr11Q13.png}{400px\\textbar{}right\\textbar{}thumbnail}\nshows the original points in ${\\color{blue}\\textrm{blue}}$ while the\ntransformed points are in ${\\color{red}\\textrm{red}}$. We complete the\nfigure by connecting the corners."

        "Actually, you only need to consider the transformation of 4 special\npoints on the square. Which points are they? The picture of the\ntransformed square follows from linking up these 4 transformed points."
