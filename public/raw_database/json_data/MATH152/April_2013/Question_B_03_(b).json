    "statement": "Let \\emph{A} be a certain $2\\times 3$ matrix. Suppose that using\nelementary row operations, the matrix \\emph{A} can be transformed into\nthe matrix\n\n\\[U = \\begin{bmatrix} \n1 & 0 & -7 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 4\n\\end{bmatrix}\\]\n\nCan you find the solution of $Ax = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix}$\nwith the given information? Justify your answer.",

        "No, this is not possible. Elementary row operations change the right\nhand side and hence, in general, solutions of \\emph{Ax = b} are not\nrelated to solutions of \\emph{Ux = b}. Only in the special case of a\nhomogeneous system, when \\emph{b = 0}, is this possible.\n\nAn easy way to see this is by a counter example. We will look at two\nmatrices \\emph{A\\textsubscript{1}} and \\emph{A\\textsubscript{2}} that\ncan both be row reduced to \\emph{U}, but have different solutions to\n$A\\mathbf{x} = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix}$\n\nLet us choose \\emph{A\\textsubscript{1} = U} and $A_2 = \\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 0 & -7 \\\\ 1 & 1 & -3\n\\end{bmatrix}$\n\n\\emph{A\\textsubscript{2}} was obtained by adding the first row of\n\\emph{U} to the second row of \\emph{U}. Hence, by subtracting row 1 from\nrow 2 in \\emph{A\\textsubscript{2}} gives \\emph{U}, which shows that\n\\emph{A\\textsubscript{2}} can be row reduced to \\emph{U}.\n\nSolving $A_1\\mathbf{x}_1 = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix}$ we get\n\n\\[\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 0 & -7 & | & 1 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 4 & | & 0\n\\end{bmatrix}\\] with solution\n\n\\[\\mathbf{x}_1 = a\\begin{bmatrix}7\\\\-4\\\\1\\end{bmatrix} + \\begin{bmatrix}1\\\\ 0 \\\\0\\end{bmatrix}\\]\n\nWhile solving $A_2\\mathbf{x}_2 = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix}$\nwe get\n\n\\[\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 0 & -7 & | & 1 \\\\ 1 & 1 & -3 & | & 0\n\\end{bmatrix} \\rightarrow \\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 0 & -7 & | & 1 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 4 & | & \\color{red} -1\\end{bmatrix}\\] with solution\n\n\\[\\mathbf{x}_2 = b\\begin{bmatrix}7\\\\-4\\\\1\\end{bmatrix} + \\begin{bmatrix}1\\\\ \\color{red} -1\\\\0\\end{bmatrix}\\]\n\nAs we see, regardless of \\emph{a} and \\emph{b} we always find\n$\\mathbf{x}_1 \\not= \\mathbf{x}_2$. Thus using the given information, we\ncannot tell which solution set is correct.", 
        "Another way to view this question is to notice that elementary row\noperations combine to give us that\n\n$\\displaystyle A = EU$\n\nwhere \\emph{E} is an invertible matrix. Thus solving\n\n$\\displaystyle Ax = \\begin{bmatrix}1 \\\\0 \\end{bmatrix}$\n\nReduces to solving\n\n$\\displaystyle Ux = E^{-1}\\begin{bmatrix}1 \\\\0 \\end{bmatrix}$\n\nThis last solution varies with the matrix \\emph{E}. Notice that if the\nvector on the right were the zero vector, then this matrix would not\nmatter (as it didn't in\n\\href{Science:Math Exam Resources/Courses/MATH152/April 2013/Question B 03 (a)}{part\n(a)}) but here it can make a huge difference. A concrete counter example\nis given in solution 1."
