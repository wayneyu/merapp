Justify your answers and show all your work.\nSimplification of answers is not required.\n\nThe population of fish in a lake is \\emph{m} million, where $m = m(t)$\nvaries with time \\emph{t} measured in years. The number of fish is\ncurrently 2 million.\n\nSuppose \\emph{m} satisfies the logistic-growth differential equation\n\n$\\frac{dm}{dt} = 16m \\left(1 - \\frac{m}{4} \\right)$\n\nWhen will the number of fish equal 3 million? You may use the fact that\nthe general solution to the logistic-growth differential equation\n$y' = ky(1-(y/K))$ is $y = K/(1 + Ae^{-kt})$ where \\emph{A} is constant.",

        "With $k=16$ and $K = 4$, we know from the problem that\n\n$m(t) = \\frac{4}{1 + Ae^{-16t}}$\n\nSolving for \\emph{A}, we use the fact that $m(0) = 2$ and see that\n\n$2 = m(0) =  \\frac{4}{1 + Ae^{-16(0)}} = \\frac{4}{1 + A}$\n\nCross multiplying, we see that\n\n$\\displaystyle 2+2A = 4$\n\nand solving gives $A = 1$. Thus, we have\n\n$m(t) = \\frac{4}{1 + e^{-16t}}$.\n\nWe want to solve for \\emph{t} when $m(t) = 3$. Plugging this in yields\n\n$3 = \\frac{4}{1 + e^{-16t}}$\n\nCross multiplying, we see that\n\n$\\displaystyle 3 + 3e^{-16t} = 4$\n\nBringing the 3 over and dividing by 3 yields\n\n$\\displaystyle e^{-16t} = \\frac{1}{3}$\n\nTaking logarithms and then dividing by -16 gives\n\n$\\displaystyle t = \\frac{-\\ln(\\frac{1}{3})}{16} = \\frac{\\ln(3)}{16}$\n\nand this completes the problem."
