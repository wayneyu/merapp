        "Using our answer from c), we can study the limit where $n$ goes to\ninfinity. In this case the probability vector approaches\n\n\\[\\hat{\\mathbf{v}} = \\lim_{n \\rightarrow \\infty}P^{n}\\mathbf{v} = \\left[\\begin{array}{c}3/11 \\\\ 8/11\\end{array}\\right].\\]\n\nHence, it is more likely, that the walker will be be in state 2 after a\nlarge number of steps, since the 2nd entry in the vector is larger than\nthe first entry."
