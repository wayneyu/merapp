    "statement": "\\textbf{Full-Solution Problem.} Justify your answer and \\textbf{show all\nyour work.} Simplification of the answer is not required.\n\nAn unknown function $f(x)$ has the following values\\[f(0) = 1\\],\n$f(1) = 2$, $f(2) = 0$, $f(3) = -2$, $f(4) = -4.$\n\nIt is known that the fourth derivative $f^{(4)}(x)$ lies between $-3$\nand $2$ on the interval $[0,4]$. What is the largest possible value that\n$\\int_0^4 f(x)dx$ could have? You may use the fact that if\n$\\left|f^{(4)}(x)\\right| \\leq K$ on the interval $[a,b]$, then the error\nin using $S_n$ to approximate $\\int_a^b f(x)dx$ has absolute value less\nthan or equal to $K(b-a)^5/180n^4$.",

        "Using the hint, we plug in $n=4$ into the error bound and notice that\nthe error lies between\n\n$\\frac{(-3)(4-0)^{5}}{180(4)^{4}} < \\frac{K(b-a)^5}{180n^4} < \\frac{(2)(4-0)^{5}}{180(4)^{4}}$\n\nEvaluating these bounds, we get that\n\n$\\frac{-12}{180} < \\frac{K(b-a)^5}{180n^4} < \\frac{8}{180}$\n\nand one last simplification yields\n\n$\\frac{-1}{15} < \\frac{K(b-a)^5}{180n^4} < \\frac{2}{45}$.\n\nNow, let's use the the approximation and notice that by definition, we\nhave that\n\n$\\left|\\int_{0}^{4}f(x)\\, dx - S_{4} \\right|  < \\frac{K(b-a)^5}{180n^4}$\n\nNotice that in magnitude, the value\n\n$\\frac{1}{15} > \\frac{2}{45}$\n\nand so we have that the largest the integral can be is the $S_{4}$\napproximation added onto this largest error bound. This gives\n\n$\\int_{0}^{4}f(x)\\, dx < S_{4} +\\frac{1}{15} = -1 + \\frac{1}{15} = \\frac{-14}{15}$\n\ncompleting the question."
