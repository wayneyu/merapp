        "The linear approximation, $L(x)$, to a function, $f(x)$, at the point\n$a$, is given by\n\n\\begin{align*}\\displaystyle\nL(x) = f(a) + f'(a)(x - a).\\end{align*}\n\nFrom the information given we can write the linear approximation to the\nfunction $f(x) = x^{1/3}$ at $a = 8$ as follows:\n\n\\begin{align*}\nL(x) &= 8^{1/3} + \\frac{1}{3}8^{-2/3}(x - 8) \\\\\n&= 2 + \\frac{1}{12}(x - 8).\\end{align*}\n\nThus, the linear approximation gives us the approximate value for\n$(7.5)^{1/3}$:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n(7.5)^{1/3} \\approx L(7.5) &= 2 + \\frac{1}{12}(7.5 - 8) \\\\\n&= 2 - \\frac{1}{24} \\\\\n&= \\frac{47}{24}.\\end{align*}\n\n(This answer is already expressed in lowest terms.)"
