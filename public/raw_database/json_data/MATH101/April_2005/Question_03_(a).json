        "We will use the method of partial fractions to solve this integral.\n\nFirst, we will rewrite the integrand:\n\n\\[\\frac{4x+4}{x(x+1)^2} =  \\frac{4x}{x(x+1)^2} + \\frac{4}{x(x+1)^2}.\\]\n\nWe can now cancel a factor of $x$, leaving:\n\n\\[\\frac{4}{(x+1)^2} + \\frac{4}{x(x+1)^2}.\\]\n\nWe have made a little progress. We have shown that\n\n\\[\\frac{4x+4}{x(x+1)^2} = \\frac{4}{(x+1)^2} + \\frac{4}{x(x+1)^2}.\\]\n\nWe want to compute\n\n\\[\\int \\frac{4x+4}{x(x+1)^2} dx.\\]\n\nBy the above computation, this integral is equal to\n\n\\[\\int \\frac{4}{(x+1)^2} + \\frac{4}{x(x+1)^2} dx,\\] which is equal to\n\n\\[\\int \\frac{4}{(x+1)^2}dx + \\int \\frac{4}{x(x+1)^2} dx,\\]\n\nby basic properties of the integral. Now we can see why breaking the\nintegrand up into pieces was helpful: the integral to the left of the\n\"+\" can be evaluated by making the substitution $u=x+1, du=dx$. Thus,\n\n\\[\\int \\frac{4}{(x+1)^2}dx = \\int \\frac{4}{u^2}du = -4u^{-1} +C= -4(x+1)^{-1} +C.\\]\n\nNow we will have to use partial fractions to compute the next integral.\nThis means we need to find constants A, B, and C to make the following\nequality true:\n\n\\[\\frac{4}{x(x+1)^2} = \\frac{A}{x} + \\frac{B}{x+1} + \\frac{C}{(x+1)^2}.\\]\n\nMultiply both sides by $x(x+1)^2$ to cancel the denominators, yielding\n\n\\[4=A(x+1)^2 + Bx(x+1) + Cx.\\] Now we expand the right hand side.\n\n\\[4 = A(x^2 +2x +1) +Bx^2 +Bx +Cx\\]\n\n\\[4= Ax^2 +2Ax +A +Bx^2 +Bx +Cx\\]\n\n\\[4 = (A+B)x^2 +(2A +B+C)x + A\\]\n\nNow since we have an equality of polynomials, we know that their\ncoefficients of $x^2$ and $x$ must be equal, as well as the constant\ncoefficient. The polynomial on the left hand side has coefficient of\n$x^2$ and $x$ equal to zero, and constant coefficient equal to 4. Thus\nwe get three equations:\n\nFor the coefficient of $x^2$:\n\n\\[0 = A+B\\]\n\nFor the coefficient of $x$:\n\n\\[0 = 2A +B +C\\]\n\nFor the constant coefficient:\n\n\\[4 = A\\]\n\nSince A=4, we get from the $x^2$ coefficient equation that\n\n\\[0= 4+B\\] Thus, B=-4. Now we can solve for C in the $x$ coefficient\nequation,\n\n\\[0 = 2*4 + (-4) +C\\] Thus, C=-4. Putting all of this together, we can\nconclude that\n\n\\[\\frac{4}{x(x+1)^2} = \\frac{4}{x} + \\frac{-4}{x+1} + \\frac{-4}{(x+1)^2}.\\]\n\nSo:\n\n\\[\\int \\frac{4}{x(x+1)^2} dx= \\int \\frac{4}{x}dx + \\int \\frac{-4}{x+1}dx + \\int \\frac{-4}{(x+1)^2}dx.\\]\n\nWe have succeeded in splitting up a difficult integral into three\nsimpler ones!\n\n\\[\\int \\frac{4}{x}dx = 4\\ln |x| +c_1,\\]\n\n\\[\\int \\frac{-4}{x+1}dx = -4 \\ln|x+1| +c_2,\\]\n\n\\[\\int \\frac{-4}{(x+1)^2}dx = 4(x+1)^{-1} +c_3,\\] where $c_1, c_2, c_3$\nare constants.\n\nThus\n\n\\[\\int \\frac{4}{x(x+1)^2} dx = 4\\ln |x| -4 \\ln|x+1|  + 4(x+1)^{-1}  +C\\]\n\nFinally, we are able to conclude that\n\n\\begin{align*}\n\\int \\frac{4x+4}{x(x+1)^2} dx = -4(x&+1)^{-1} + 4\\ln |x| \\\\\n&-4 \\ln|x+1|  + 4(x+1)^{-1}  +C \n\\end{align*}\n\nwhere the term $-4(x+1)^{-1}$ comes from the integral we did at the very\nbeginning. Notice two terms cancel out to get as our final answer\n\n\\[\\int \\frac{4x+4}{x(x+1)^2} \\textrm{d}x = 4\\ln |x| -4\\ln|x+1| +C.\\]"
