        "The variance for a discrete random variable is defined to be\n\n\\begin{align*}\\operatorname{Var}(X) = \\sum_{x_{i}}(x_{i} - \\mu)^{2}P(X = x_{i})\\end{align*}\n\nwhere the values $x_{i}$, are the possible outcomes for the random\nvariable $X$ and $\\mu$ is the mean:\n\n\\begin{align*}\\mu = \\sum_{x_{i}}x_{i}P(X = x_{i}).\\end{align*}\n\nIn this case, there are only two possible outcomes $X = 0$ or $X = 1$.\nIf we define the probability $P(X = 1)$ with $p$ then by the law that\nthe sum of the probabilities for all events must sum to one, we know\nthat $P(X = 0) = 1 - P(X = 1) = 1 - p$. Thus,\n\n\\begin{align*}\\,\\mu = 0P(X = 0) + 1P(X = 1) = p.\\end{align*} Now we can use the definition of\nvariance and get an equation for $p$.\n\n\\begin{align*}\n\\operatorname{Var}(X) = (0-p)^{2}\\underbrace{P(X = 0)}_{=1-p} + (1 - p)^{2}P(X = 1) &= 1/4 \\\\  \n-p^{2}(1 - p) + (1 - p)^{2}p &= 1/4 \\\\ \n-p^{2} + p - 1/4 &= 0\\\\ \np^{2} - p + 1/4 &= 0 \\\\ \n(p - 1/2)^{2} &= 0\\end{align*} Thus, the value of $p$ such that Var(X) = 1/4 is\n$p = 1/2$."
