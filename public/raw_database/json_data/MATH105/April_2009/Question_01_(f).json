        "We proceed as suggested by the hints. Let\n$\\displaystyle u = x^{2} - 4x + 7$ so that\n$\\displaystyle du = (2x - 4)dx = 2(x-2)dx$. This gives\n\n\\[\\displaystyle \\int \\frac{x-2}{(x^{2}-4x + 7)^{2}}\\,dx = \\int \\frac{du}{2u^{2}}\\]\n\nIntegrating gives\n\n\\[\\displaystyle \\int \\frac{du}{2u^{2}} = \\frac{-1}{2u} + C = \\frac{-1}{2(x^{2}-4x+7)} + C\\]"
