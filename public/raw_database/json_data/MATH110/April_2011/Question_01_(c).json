        "An inflection point is a point where $f''$ is zero or undefined\n\\textbf{and} the graph changes concavity. A critical point is a point\n\\emph{c} where either $f'(c) = 0$ or $f'(c)$ does not exist.\n\nIt is possible for a point to satisfy both definitions. Such a function\nhas a point where both the first and second derivative are equal to\nzero. One such simple function is $f(x) = x^3$. It has a horizontal\ntangent line at $x = 0$ (making $x = 0$ a critical point) and also\nchanges concavity at $x = 0$.\n\nThus the statement is \\textbf{true}."
