    "statement": "Consider the curve $x^2+y^3-2xy=0$. Assume that the point \\emph{(x,y) =\n(1,1)} lies on the curve, and that nearby points on the curve satisfy\n\\emph{y=f(x)} for some function of \\emph{f(x)}.\n\nApproximate \\emph{f(1.02)} using the linear approximation of \\emph{f(x)}\nat \\emph{x=1}. State whether you expect this to be an overestimate, or\nan underestimate of \\emph{f(1.02)}.",

        "The linear approximation formula is\n\n\\[\\displaystyle{}L(x)=f(a)+f'(a)(x-a).\\]\n\nThe number \\emph{a} is the value we are approximating around and thus in\nour case \\emph{a}=1. Since we are trying to approximate f(1.02) we take\n\\emph{x}=1.02. Using the information from\n\\href{Science:Math_Exam_Resources/Courses/MATH104/December_2012/Question_6_(a)}{part\n(a)} we have that\n\n\\[\\displaystyle{}f(1.02)\\approx{}L(1.02)=f(1)+f'(1)(1.02-1)=1+0(0.02)=1.\\]\n\nThis gives the estimate that $f(1.02) = 1$. From\n\\href{Science:Math_Exam_Resources/Courses/MATH104/December_2012/Question_6_(b)}{part\n(b)}, the second derivative at x=1 is negative and therefore we see that\nthe function is concave down at this point. This tells us that points\nnear x=1 are smaller than what the tangent line predicts and therefore\nwe expect that our estimate is an overestimate."
