    "statement": "Alice is 5 ft tall and Bob is 6 ft tall. At some instant they are both\nwalking towards a street lamp 15 ft high with Alice west of the lamp and\nBob east of the lamp. Suppose at this instant, Alice is walking at 4\nft/s and the distance between the tips of their shadows is decreasing at\n11 ft/s.\n\nHow fast is Bob walking?",

        "This question heavily relies on understanding the problem and the\ndiagram in\n\\href{Science:Math_Exam_Resources/Courses/MATH104/December_2012/Question_5_(a)}{part\n(a)} and thus all notation here out refers to the diagram in\n\\href{Science:Math_Exam_Resources/Courses/MATH104/December_2012/Question_5_(a)}{part\n(a)}. The diagram labels the important triangles and values. The key\nrelationships needed are in $T_{1}$ (from Alice's head to the lamp post\nto L), triangle APL, $T_{2}$ (from Bob's head to the lamp post to L),\nand triangle BPL. Let C denote the length of the segment AP and let D\ndenote the length of the segment BP.\n\nThe next hints will be successions of understanding what the values are\nwith respect to these letters.", 
        "We are given that\n\n$\\frac{dx}{dt} = -4$ (notice that the negative is here since the size of\n\\emph{x} is decreasing over time as Alice and Bob are walking towards\nthe lamppost).\n\nNotice that the distance between the tips of the shadows is given by\n$C + D$. Thus, we are also given that\n\n$\\frac{d(C + D)}{dt}  = \\frac{dC}{dt} + \\frac{dD}{dt} = -11$ (notice\nthat the negative is here since the distance is decreasing over time as\ngiven by the question).", 
        "Bob's distance to the lamp is y and so the speed he is walking is\n\n\\[\\frac{dy}{dt}\\].\n\nWhat do we expect the sign of this number to be in the end?\n\nUse similar triangles for the triangles mentioned in hint 1 using the\npicture from\n\\href{Science:Math_Exam_Resources/Courses/MATH104/December_2012/Question_5_(a)}{part\n(a)} and relate all these hints to create a solution."
