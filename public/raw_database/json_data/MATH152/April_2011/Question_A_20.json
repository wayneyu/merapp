        "The absolute value (or modulus) of a complex number $a+bi$ is\n\n\\begin{align*}r = \\sqrt{a^2+b^2}=\\sqrt{(-1)^2+1^2}=\\sqrt 2\\end{align*} and the argument,\n$\\theta$, is the angle between the right side of the $x$-axis and the\nposition of the complex number on the plane. In this case, the argument\nis $3\\pi /4$. To see that, you can either just visually see that the\npoint (-1,1) is clearly on the diagonal of the second quadrant of the\nplane, or using trigonometry have\n\n\\begin{align*}\\cos(\\theta)=\\frac{a}{r}=\\frac{-1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\quad\\text{and}\\quad \\sin(\\theta)=\\frac{b}{r}=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\end{align*}\nand from there notice that the corresponding angle is $3\\pi /4$ (or in\nreal life compute the angle using a calculator since you only know a\nvery few values of sine and cosine).\n\nSo this allows us to write our complex number in polar form as\n\n\\begin{align*}-1+i=re^{\\theta i}=\\sqrt 2 e^{3\\pi i/4}\\end{align*}"
