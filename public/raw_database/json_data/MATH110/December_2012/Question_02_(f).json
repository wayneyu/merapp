    "sols": [
        "Horizontal tangent lines occur when the derivative equals zero. The\nderivative of \\emph{y} is\n\n$y' = \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{x}}$\n\nHowever, this derivative is never zero, because for all positive values\nof \\emph{x} (the domain of the derivative), $y'$ will be a positive\nnumber, not zero.\n\nThus $y = \\sqrt{x}$ has no horizontal tangent lines, so the statement is\ntrue."

    "hints": [
        "In order for a function to have horizontal tangent lines, at some point\nits derivative must be equal to zero."
