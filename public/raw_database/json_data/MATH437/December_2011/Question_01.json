        "Assume towards a contradiction that $\\displaystyle n \\mid (2^{n}-1)$.\n\nLet \\emph{p} be the smallest prime dividing \\emph{n}. Notice that\n$\\displaystyle 2^{n}-1$ is odd and so \\emph{p} is not 2. Thus, we have\nthat\n\n$\\displaystyle 2^{n} \\equiv 1 \\mod{p}$\n\nand by Fermat's Little Theorem, we also have that\n\n$\\displaystyle 2^{p-1} \\equiv 1 \\mod{p}$.\n\nThus, we also have that (via the Euclidean Algorithm)\n\n$\\displaystyle 2^{\\gcd(n,p-1)} \\equiv 1 \\mod{p}$.\n\nHowever $\\displaystyle \\gcd(n,p-1) = 1$ since \\emph{p} was the smallest\nprime dividing \\emph{n}. This gives us that\n\n$\\displaystyle 2 \\equiv 1 \\mod{p}$\n\nwhich is a contradiction."
