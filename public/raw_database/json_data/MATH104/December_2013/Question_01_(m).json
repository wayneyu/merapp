        "The correct answer is (C).\n\nTo see this, notice that the equation of the line using the point slope\nformula is given by\n\n$\\displaystyle \\frac{y-2}{x-3} = f'(3) = 5$.\n\nIsolating gives\n\n$\\displaystyle y-2 = 5(x-3)$\n\nand simplifying one last time\n\n$\\displaystyle y = 5x -13$.\n\nWe are using this line to approximate $\\displaystyle f(x)$. Thus, if we\nset $\\displaystyle y=0$ and solve, we can get an approximation to the\nroot of $\\displaystyle f(x)$. Hence\n\n$\\displaystyle 0 = 5x- 13$ which gives $\\displaystyle x = 13/5 = 2.6$\nand thus the correct answer is (C)."

        "First, we find the equation of the tangent line. Remember that the\nderivative at a point gives you the slope of the tangent line.", 
        "Once you have the tangent line, use it to approximate f(x). Thus, we\nhave\n\n$\\displaystyle f(x) \\approx y = f'(3)x + b$\n\nwhere we solved \\emph{b} by plugging in the point $\\displaystyle (3,2)$\ninto $\\displaystyle y=mx+b$.\n\nNow set the above equation to 0 and solve."
