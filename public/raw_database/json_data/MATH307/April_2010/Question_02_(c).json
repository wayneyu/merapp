    "statement": "A real matrix $A_{5\\times 5}$ is brought into its Jordan canonical form\n\n$B = \\begin{pmatrix}\n1& 1 &0 & 0 &0 \\\\\n0&1 &0 &0 &0 \\\\\n0& 0 &0 &0 &0 \\\\\n0 &0 &0 &-1 &0 \\\\\n0 &0 &0 &0 &-1\n\\end{pmatrix}$\n\nby a matrix $S_{5\\times 5}$, i.e. $\\displaystyle A = SBS^{-1}$. Answer\nthe questions below, substantiate all your statements.\n\n\\textbf{(c)} What is the dimension of the kernel of\n$\\displaystyle A + I$ (\\emph{I} being the \\emph{5x5} identity matrix)?",

        "The kernel of $A + I = N(A + I)$ where\n$N(A + I) = \\left \\{x | (A + I)x = 0 \\right \\}$\n\nSince $(A + I)x = 0$, then $(A - (-1)I)x = 0$.\n\nThis means to find $\\dim(N(A + I))$, we just need to find the dimension\nof the nullspace of A with the eigenvalue -1.\n\nFrom matrix B, we can see that the eigenvalue -1 appears twice, and that\nthey are not from the same Jordan block. If they were from the same\nJordan block, then there would be a 1 shown at entry (4,5). Since it\nappears twice, we know that the dimension of the eigenspace (i.e.\n$N(A - (-1)I)$ for the eigenvalue -1 is equal to 2.\n\nTherefore, $\\dim(N(A+I)) = 2$"
