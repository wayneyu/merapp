    "statement": "A player begins a game of chance by placing a marker in box 2, marked\nstart. A die is rolled, and the marker is moved one square to the left\nif a 1 or 2 is rolled and one square to the right if a 3, 4, 5, or 6 is\nrolled. This process continues until the marker lands in square 1, in\nwhich case the player wins the game, or in square 4, in which case the\nplayer loses the game.\n\n\\textbf{(c)} Given that when the initial state $x_0$ is written in terms\nof the eigenvectors, $v_i$, the coe\u00ef\u00ac\u0083cients\n$(c_1, c_2, c_3, c_4) = (0.43, 0.57, 0.28, 0.93)$, determine the\nprobability of winning the game. Explain your solution by writing a\nexpression for the long-time behaviour of the game in terms of $c_i$,\n$\\lambda_i$, and $v_i$.",

        "Since $v_1$ and $v_2$ are the end states of the game (landing on the\nwinning and losing square, respectively), $c_1$ and $c_2$ represent the\nprobabilities of winning and losing, respectively. (They sum to 1,\nshowing that if the game goes on long enough, it will end at one of\nthese two states.) So the probability of winning the game is 0.43. Since\ntwo of the $\\lambda_i$ have magnitude 1 (these being $\\lambda_1$ and\n$\\lambda_2$), the long-term behaviour of this matrix is a linear\ncombination of the corresponding $v_i$, with coefficients being the\ncorresponding $c_i$ (this depends on $x_0$ because there is more than\none $\\lambda_i$ with magnitude 1). In this case, these are $c_1$, $v_1$,\n$c_2$, and $v_2$. Thus the long-term behaviour of the game is\n$c_1 * v_1 + c_2 * v_2$."
