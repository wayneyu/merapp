        "Our differentiation rules at this point only address functions that are\nin the form $y = f(x)$. Thus our first step is to transform the equation\nof a circle into this form by solving for \\emph{y}.\n\n\\begin{align*}\nx^2 + y^2 &= 25 \\\\\ny^2 &= 25 - x^2 \\\\\ny &= \\pm \\sqrt{25 - x^2}\\end{align*}\n\nBecause our point of concern is on the lower half of the circle, we will\nuse the negative square root.\n\nWe now proceed to find the slope of the tangent line at (3, -4). First\nwe take the derivative using the chain rule.\n\n\\begin{align*}\nf(x) &= -\\sqrt{25 - x^2} \\\\\nf'(x)&= - \\frac12 (25-x^2)^{-\\frac12}(-2x) \\\\\n &= \\frac{x}{\\sqrt{25-x^2}} \\end{align*}\n\nTo find the slope, we plug \\emph{x = 3} into the derivative to get:\n\n$\\displaystyle f'(3) = \\frac{3}{\\sqrt{25 - 3^2}} = \\frac{3}{4}$\n\nWe now have a slope, $3/4$, and a point, $(3, -4)$. Plugging these into\nour equation of a line we get:\n\n$y + 4 = \\frac{3}{4}(x - 3)$"
