        "This function is a polynomial of degree 4, so the curve sketching\nshouldn't offer too many difficulties. We have collected the following\ninformation:\n\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\itemsep1pt\\parskip0pt\\parsep0pt\n\\item\n  The function has no horizontal asymptotes (from\n  \\href{Science:Math Exam Resources/Courses/MATH102/December 2011/Question 4 (i)}{part\n  i)} )\n\\item\n  The function has a global minimum at \\emph{x} = 0 (from\n  \\href{Science:Math Exam Resources/Courses/MATH102/December 2011/Question 4 (ii)}{part\n  ii)} )\n\\item\n  The function has two inflection points at \\emph{x} = 1 and \\emph{x} =\n  3 (from\n  \\href{Science:Math Exam Resources/Courses/MATH102/December 2011/Question 4 (iii)}{part\n  iii)} )\n\\item\n  The function is decreasing up to its minimum and then increasing,\n  except at \\emph{x} = 3 where it has an inflexion point (from\n  \\href{Science:Math Exam Resources/Courses/MATH102/December 2011/Question 4 (iv)}{part\n  iv)} )\n\\item\n  The function is concave up all the way up to \\emph{x} = 1, then\n  concave down until \\emph{x} = 3 and then concave up again (from\n  \\href{Science:Math Exam Resources/Courses/MATH102/December 2011/Question 4 (v)}{part\n  v)} )\n\\end{itemize}\n\nTo get a better idea of what to sketch, we quickly compute the second\ncoordinates of the three points of interests:\n\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\itemsep1pt\\parskip0pt\\parsep0pt\n\\item\n  Global minimum at (0,0)\n\\item\n  Inflection points at (1, 11/4) and (3, 27/4)\n\\end{itemize}\n\nThis allows us to sketch the graph of this function. As we saw above,\nthis function is always positive, reaches a global minimum at the point\n(0,0) and has two inflection points. This should give you a picture that\nlooks like:\n\n\\begin{figure}[htbp]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=.5\\textwidth]{MER_MATH102_Dec_2011_Q4vi.png}\n\\caption{MER MATH102 Dec 2011 Q4vi.png}\n\\end{figure}"

        "The previous questions have given you all the information you need to be\nable to transfer all that algebraic information into something geometric\n(the sketch of the graph).\n\nAsk yourself:\n\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\itemsep1pt\\parskip0pt\\parsep0pt\n\\item\n  What does an asymptote (vertical or horizontal) look like?\n\\item\n  What does a local maximum or minimum look like?\n\\item\n  What about an inflexion point?\n\\item\n  What does it look like when the function is increasing/decreasing?\n\\item\n  What does it look like when the function is concave up/concave down?\n\\end{itemize}\n\nWhatever you sketch, check whether your drawing matches the information\nyou collected."
