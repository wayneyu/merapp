Justify your answers and show all your work.\nSimplification of answers is not required.\n\nThe vertical cross-sections of a bathtub perpendicular to its long axis\nhave the shape shown below. They are squares of side length 50cm\nsurmounting a semicircle. Assuming the tub is full of water, find the\nhydrostatic force on one of its vertical ends (which also has the shape\nbelow). For the density of water, use the value 1000\nkg/m\\textsuperscript{3} and for the acceleration due to gravity, use the\nvalue 9.8 m/s\\textsuperscript{2}.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htbp]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=.5\\textwidth]{MATH101Apr2006Q5Statement.jpeg}\n\\caption{MATH101Apr2006Q5Statement.jpeg}\n\\end{figure}",

        "Start by placing a coordinate system on your picture with 0 on top. We\nbreak the problem up into two parts. First, we take care of the square.\n\nChoose a sample point $\\displaystyle x_{i}^{*}$ somewhere between 0 and\n50 on your picture. Draw the horizontal line across at this point. A\npicture is included below.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htbp]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=.5\\textwidth]{Math101042006Q5pt1.jpg}\n\\caption{Math101042006Q5pt1.jpg}\n\\end{figure}\n\nThe area of this horizontal strip is given by\n\n$\\displaystyle A_{i} = 50\\Delta x$.\n\nThe pressure on this strip is given by\n\n$\\displaystyle P_{i} = \\rho g x_{i}^{*}$.\n\nwhere $\\displaystyle \\rho = 1000$ is the density of water and\n$\\displaystyle g = 9.8$ is the acceleration due to gravity. Thus, the\nforce on this strip is\n\n$\\displaystyle F_{i} = P_{i}A_{i} = 50\\rho g x_{i}^{*} \\Delta x$.\n\nThe total force is\n\n$\\displaystyle F_{sq} = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}F_{i} =  \\lim_{n \\to \\infty}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}50\\rho g x_{i}^{*} \\Delta x$.\n\nThis can be expressed as the following integral\n\n$\\displaystyle F_{sq} = \\int_{0}^{50}50\\rho g x \\, dx$\n\nNow we compute the force on the semicircle and add it to this force to\nget the total force. To make the notation easier, I will reuse some of\nthe letters from above.\n\nChoose a sample point $\\displaystyle x_{i}^{*}$ somewhere between 50 and\n75 on your picture. Draw the horizontal line across at this point. A\npicture is included below.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htbp]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=.5\\textwidth]{Math101042006Q5pt3.jpg}\n\\caption{Math101042006Q5pt3.jpg}\n\\end{figure}\n\nTo compute the length of the horizontal line, draw the radius as shown\nin the picture. Then the Pythagorean theorem tells us that the length\nacross is double $\\displaystyle \\sqrt{25^{2} - (x_{i}^{*}-50)^{2}}$.\nThus, the area of this strip is given by\n\n$\\displaystyle A_{i} = 2\\sqrt{25^{2} - (x_{i}^{*}-50)^{2}}\\Delta x$.\n\nThe pressure on this strip is given by\n\n$\\displaystyle P_{i} = \\rho g x_{i}^{*}$.\n\nThus, the force on this strip is\n\n$\\displaystyle F_{i} = P_{i}A_{i} = 2\\sqrt{25^{2} - (x_{i}^{*}-50)^{2}}\\rho g x_{i}^{*} \\Delta x$.\n\nThe total force is\n\n$\\displaystyle F_{circ} = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}F_{i} =  \\lim_{n \\to \\infty}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}2\\sqrt{25^{2} - (x_{i}^{*}-50)^{2}}\\rho g x_{i}^{*} \\Delta x$.\n\nThis can be expressed as the following integral\n\n$\\displaystyle F_{circ} = \\int_{50}^{75}2\\sqrt{25^{2} - (x-50)^{2}}\\rho g x \\, dx$\n\nAdding the two integrals together, we get\n\n\\begin{align*}\nF_{tot} &= F_{sq} + F_{circ} \\\\\n&= \\int_{0}^{50}50\\rho g x + \\int_{50}^{75}2\\sqrt{25^{2} - (x-50)^{2}}\\rho g x \\, dx \\\\\n&= \\frac{50\\rho g x^{2}}{2} \\bigg|_{0}^{50} + \\int_{0}^{25}2\\sqrt{25^{2} - x^{2}}\\rho g (x+50) \\, dx\\\\\n&= 25\\rho g (50)^{2} + \\int_{0}^{25}2\\sqrt{25^{2} - x^{2}}\\rho g x \\, dx + \\int_{0}^{25}100\\sqrt{25^{2} - x^{2}}\\rho g \\, dx\\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\nThe last integral can be recognized as the {[}scaled{]} area of a\nquarter circle of a circle with radius 25. The first integral we can let\n$\\displaystyle u = 25^{2} - x^{2}$. When \\emph{x} = 0, then \\emph{u}=\n625 and when \\emph{x} = 25 then \\emph{u}=0 and\n$\\displaystyle du = -2xdx$. Hence,\n\n\\begin{align*}\nF_{tot} &= 25\\rho g (50)^{2} - \\int_{625}^{0}\\sqrt{u}\\rho g \\, du + 100\\rho g \\frac{\\pi(25)^{2}}{4}\\\\\n&= 25\\rho g (50)^{2} + \\int_{0}^{625}\\sqrt{u}\\rho g \\, du + 25\\rho g \\pi(25)^{2}\\\\\n&= 25\\rho g (50)^{2} + \\frac{2u^{3/2}\\rho g}{3} \\bigg|_{0}^{625} + \\rho g \\pi(25)^{3}\\\\\n&= 25\\rho g (50)^{2} + \\frac{2(25)^{3}\\rho g}{3} + \\rho g \\pi(25)^{3}\\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\nwhich is our final answer."

        "It helps to break this problem up into two shapes and deal with the\nforce on each shape. Put a coordinate system on this figure so that 0 is\non top. Then choose a sample point first only in the square then next\nonly in the semicircle.", 
        "For the semicircle, at a sample point, draw a horizontal line and\nconnect a radius from the centre of the semicircle to the intersection\npoint with the horizontal line and the semicircle. Then use Pythagorean\ntheorem to determine lengths. A picture is included in the solution and\nmight make this hint clearer.", 
        "Recall that the hydrostatic pressure at a depth h measured from the top\nof a surface is given by,\n\n\\[\\displaystyle P=\\rho{g}h\\]\n\nwhere $\\displaystyle  \\rho$ is the density of the substance exerting the\nforce (water in this case) and $\\displaystyle  g$ is the acceleration\ndue to gravity."
