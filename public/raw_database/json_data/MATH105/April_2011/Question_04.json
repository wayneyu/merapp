        "Let us write the supply and demand function as functions in the price\n$p$. The text says that at a price $p$ the supplier produces $p-2$\nunits. Thus, the supply function must be\n\n\\[\\displaystyle\np = S(q) = q + 2\\]\n\nAt a price $p$ the consumer demands $65/p - 10$ units. In terms of the\ndemand function this translates into\n\n\\[p = D(q) = \\frac{65}{q+10}\\]\n\nBy definition, the \\emph{market equilibrium} is the intersection point\nof the graph of $S(q)$ and $D(q)$. Let us denote this point by\n$(q_e,p_e)$. To compute that point, we set both functions equal and\ncompute a solution for $q$:\n\n\\begin{align*}\nS(q) &= D(q) \\\\\nq + 2 &= \\frac{65}{q+10}\n\\end{align*} And rearranging we obtain the equation\n\n\\begin{align*}\n(q+2)(q+10) &= 65 \\\\\nq^2 + 12q - 45 &= 0\n\\end{align*}\n\nThis is a quadratic equation and can be solved with the help of the\n$abc$-formula: the solutions to a quadratic equation of the form\n$ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ are given by\n\n\\[x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\\]\n\nNote, that in our problem the variable $x$ is replaced by the variable\n$q$ and we have $a = 1$, $b = 12$ and $x = -45$. Hence,\n\n\\[q = \\frac{-12 \\pm \\sqrt{144 + 180}}{2} = -6 \\pm 9\\]\n\nThe solution $-6 - 9$ is not feasible, because quantities are always\nnonnegative. Hence, we arrive at the unique solution $q_e = -6 + 9 = 3$.\nWe can calculate the associated price by using $D(q)$ or $S(q)$. Since\n$S(q)$ looks simpler than $D(q)$ we use $S(q)$ and get\n$p = S(q_e) = S(3) = 3 + 2 = 5$. Note, that this price is in between the\nrange given in the problem. Let us summarize:\n\n\\textbf{The market equilibrium is attained at $(q_e,p_e) = (3,5)$}\n\nThe second part of the question asks us to compute the \\emph{consumer\nsurplus}. By definition, the consumer surplus is given by the formula\n\n\\[\\text{consumer surplus} = \\int_0^{q_e} (D(q) - p_e)\\, dq\\]\n\nThe following steps compute this integral:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n\\int_0^{q_e} (D(q) - p_e)\\, dq &= \\int_0^3 \\left(\\frac{65}{q+10} - 5\\right) \\, dq \\\\\n&= 65\\int_0^3 \\frac{1}{q+10} \\, dq - \\int_0^3 5\\, dq \\\\\n&= 65\\ln(q+10)\\Bigr|_0^3 - 5q\\Bigr|_0^3 \\\\\n&= 65(\\ln(13) - \\ln(10)) - 15 \\\\\n&= 65\\ln(13/10) - 15 \\\\\n&\\approx 2.05\n\\end{align*}\n\n\\emph{The consumer surplus is approximately \\$2.05}"
