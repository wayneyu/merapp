        "We begin with assuming there is a governing equation $M(x,y) = 0$ and\ndifferentiating this with respect to x.\n\nThen, $\\frac{d}{dx} M(x,y) = M_x (x,y) + M_y (x,y) \\frac{dy}{dx} = 0$.\n\nHence, $M_x = a x^3 e^{x+y} + bx^4 e^{x+y} + 2x$ and\n$M_y = x^4 e^{x+y} + 2y$.\n\nBy Clairaut's theorem, there must be equality of mixed partial\nderivatives, and $M_{xy} = M_{yx}$. In our problem,\n\n\\begin{align*} M_{xy} &= ax^3 e^{x+y} + bx^4 e^{x+y} \\\\ M_{yx} &= 4x^3 e^{x+y} + x^4 e^{x+y} \\\\ &\\implies a=4, b=1 \\end{align*}\n\nby comparing the coefficients of $x^3 e^{x+y}$ and $x^4 e^{x+y}$."
