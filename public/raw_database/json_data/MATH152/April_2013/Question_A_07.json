        "\\textbf{No} it is not possible for two planes to intersect in two\nlinearly independent lines.\n\nTwo planes in $\\mathbb{R}^{3}$ intersect in either a line, a plane\n(which is generated by two linearly independent vectors) or not at all.\nIf they intersect in a plane or not at all, then their normal vectors\nare parallel. Otherwise they intersect in a line which cannot contain\ntwo parallel vectors.\n\nFor a more technical explanation, consider a point on both planes. Let\nthe first plane be given by\n\n\\[\\displaystyle{}n_1x+n_2y+n_3z=a\\]\n\nand the second plane by\n\n\\[\\displaystyle{}m_1x+m_2y+m_3z=b.\\]\n\nThe normal vectors are not parallel and so $<n_1,n_2,n_3>$ and\n$<m_1,m_2,m_3>$ are linearly independent. In a linear system, we can\nwrite this as\n\n\\[\\begin{bmatrix}\nn_1  &  n_2  &  n_3\\\\\nm_1  &  m_2  &  m_3\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\begin{bmatrix}\nx\\\\\ny\\\\\nz\n\\end{bmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{bmatrix}\na\\\\\nb\n\\end{bmatrix}.\\]\n\nHere we have two equations with three unknowns and this tells us that\nthere is at least one free variable. Since the normal vectors are\nlinearly independent, then there is only one free variable.\nGeometrically, one free variable corresponds to a line in space and so\nthere is only one line which could contain the points of intersection of\nthe two planes."
