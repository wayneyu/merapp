    "statement": "You open a savings account under the Escalator Plan with an initial\ndeposit of $\\$P$. The advantage of this plan is that the interest rate\nis not fixed, but grows proportionally with time as long as the account\nis alive. In other words, the money in the account collects interest at\nthe annual rate of $rt$ at time $t,$ compounded continuously (here $r$\nis a constant). You also keep adding money to the account in the form of\na continuous deposit of $\\$S(t)$ at time $t.$\n\nNow suppose that $P = 100$, $r = 0.01$, and $S(t) = 0.$ Under these\nassumptions, solve the initial value problem you wrote down in\n\\href{Science:Math_Exam_Resources/Courses/MATH105/April_2011/Question_05_(a)}{part\n(a)}.",

        "We now know that $S(t) = 0$ for all $t$ and $r = 0.01$ as well\n$P = 100$. Thus, our differential equation specializes to\n\n\\begin{align*}\\dfrac{dA}{dt} = 0.01t \\cdot A\\end{align*}\n\nwith the initial condition $A(0) = 100$. This is a \\emph{separable}\ndifferential equation that can be written as\n\n\\begin{align*}\\frac{1}{A} \\cdot \\frac{dA}{dt} = 0.01 t\\end{align*}\n\nThe first step to solve this differential equation is to integrate both\nsides of the equation with respect to $t$:\n\n\\begin{align*}\\int \\frac{1}{A} \\cdot \\frac{dA}{dt} \\, dt = \\int 0.01 t \\, dt\\end{align*}\n\nInformally, in the integrand of the integral on the left-hand side the\n$dt$ terms cancel out each other. We arrive at\n\n\\begin{align*}\n\\int \\frac{1}{A} \\, dA &= 0.01 \\cdot \\frac{t^2}{2} + C_1\\\\\n&= 0.005 t^2 + C_1\\end{align*}\n\nThe integral on the left-hand side is just $\\ln|A| + C_2$ for a constant\n$C_2$. Since from the context $A$ is always nonnegative, we can ignore\nthe absolute value brackets. In addition, we can combine the two\nconstants $C_1$ and $C_2$ to a new constant that we denote by $C_3$. We\narrive at\n\n\\begin{align*}\\displaystyle\\ln(A) = 0.005 t^2 + C_3\\end{align*}\n\nApplying the exponential function on both side of the equation results\nin\n\n\\begin{align*}A = e^{0.005 t^2 + C_3} = C_4 e^{0.005 t^2}\\end{align*}\n\nWe use the initial condition $A(0) = 100$ to determine the constant\n$C_4$:\n\n\\begin{align*}100 = A(0) = C_4 e^{0.005 \\cdot 0^2} = C_4 e^0 = C_4\\end{align*}\n\nHence, the solution to the initial value problem is given by the\nfunction\n\n\\begin{align*}A(t) = 100e^{0.005 \\cdot t^2}\\end{align*}"
