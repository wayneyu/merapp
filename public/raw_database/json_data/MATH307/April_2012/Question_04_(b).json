        "From\n\\href{Science:Math_Exam_Resources/Courses/MATH307/April_2012/Question_04_(a)}{part\n(a)} of the question, we determined that $N(D) = \\vec{1}$ so the\ndimension of $N(D)$ is equal to 1, $dim(N(D)) = 1$.\n\nTo find $N(D^{T})$, we can use the rank-nullity theorem which\nstates\\[dim(N(A)) = m - r(A)\\] Where m is the number of columns in the\nmatrix.\n\nRemember that $r(A) = dim(R(A))$ so\\[dim(N(A)) = m - dim(R(A))\\]\n\nSo, if we solve for $dim(R(A))$, we get\\[dim(R(A)) = m - dim(N(A))\\]\n$dim(R(A)) = 3 - 1$ $dim(R(A)) = r(A) = 2$\n\nWe can now use $dim(R(A)) = 2$ to solve for $dim(N(D^{T}))$ using the\nrank-nullity again. Finding $dim(N(D^{T}))$ does not directly give a\nsolution to the question, but it does tell us how many vectors there are\nin $N(D^{T})$. The rank-nullity theorem states\nthat\\[dim(N(D^{T})) = n - r(D)\\] where n is the number of rows. Plugging\nin for what we solved above $r(A) = 2$, we get\\[dim(N(D^{T})) = 3 - 2\\]\n$dim(N(D^{T})) = 1$\n\nThis shows that there is only 1 vector in $N(D^{T})$\n\nNow solving for what the question asks, lets look at $D^{T}$\\[D^{T} =\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n-1 & 0 & -1 \\\\\n1 & -1 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\\]\n\nTo find the nullspace of $D^{T}$, we have to find vectors $\\vec{v}$ such\nthat $D^{T} \\vec{v} = 0$. Looking at $D^{T}$, we can easily see that the\nonly solution to this problem is\\[\\vec{v} = \n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ -1\n\\end{bmatrix}\\]\n\nThis also matches our expectation that there is only 1 vector in\nN(D\\textsuperscript{T}).\n\nProof:\n\n$rref(D) =\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n\n0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n\n\\end{bmatrix}$\n\n$\\begin{bmatrix}\n\nx_{1} \\\\\n\nx_{2} \\\\\n\nx_{3}7\n\n\\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix}\n\n-1 \\\\\n\n-1 \\\\\n\n1\n\n\\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix}\n\n1 \\\\\n\n1 \\\\\n\n-1\n\n\\end{bmatrix}$ $N(D) = \\begin{bmatrix}\n\n1 \\\\\n\n1 \\\\\n\n-1\n\n\\end{bmatrix}$\n\nFINAL ANSWER\n\n$\\vec{v} =  \\begin{bmatrix}\n\n1 \\\\\n\n1 \\\\\n\n-1\n\n\\end{bmatrix}$"
