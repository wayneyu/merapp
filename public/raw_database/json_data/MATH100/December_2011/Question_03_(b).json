        "We are given acceleration and asked to argue about distance. Since the\nderivative of a position function is velocity and the derivative of a\nvelocity function is acceleration, we with to antidifferentiate our\noriginal function twice. This was done in part (a) giving the answer of\n\n\\[\\displaystyle\nf(t) = 2t^3-15t^2+36t\\]\n\nAs this is a position function, we need to check when the particle\nreverses direction. This occurs potentially at critical points. We know\nthe derivative of $f(t)$ is $v(t)$ and so, setting this equal to\nzero and solving gives\n\n\\[\\displaystyle 0 = f'(t) = 6t^{2} - 30t + 36 = 6(t^{2} - 5t + 6) = 6(t-3)(t-2)\\]\n\nand hence the critical points are at $t=2,3$. Since we only care about\ntime up to $t=3$, we only need to check whether the point at $t=2$ is a\nmaximum or minimum. Using the second derivative test we see that\n\n\\[\\displaystyle\nf''(2) = v'(2) = a(2) = 12(2)-30 = -6 < 0\\]\n\nand thus \\emph{t=2} is a maximum of $f$. In particular, this means that\nour particle changes directions at \\emph{t}=2. Thus, we calculate the\ntotal distance traveled up to \\emph{t}=2 first then from \\emph{t}=2\nuntil \\emph{t}=3:\n\n\\begin{align*}\nf(0) & =2(0)^3-15(0)^2+36(0) \\\\\n& = 0\n\\end{align*}\n\n\n\\begin{align*}\nf(2) & =2(2)^3-15(2)^2+36(2) \\\\\n& = 2(8)-15(4)+72 \\\\\n& = 16 - 60 + 72 \\\\\n& = 28\n\\end{align*}\n\n\n\\begin{align*}\nf(3) & =2(3)^3-15(3)^2+36(3) \\\\\n& = 2(27)-15(9)+108 \\\\\n& = 54 - 135 + 108 \\\\\n& = 27\n\\end{align*}\n The total distance traveled from \\emph{t}=0 to\n\\emph{t}=2 is:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n|f(2)-f(0)| & = |28-0|\n& = 28\n\\end{align*}\n\nThen, we can calculate the total distance traveled from \\emph{t}=2 to\n\\emph{t}=3:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n|f(3)-f(2)| & = |27-28|\n& = 1\n\\end{align*}\n\nWe add these two values together to obtain the total distance traveled\nin the first three seconds, which we find to be 29 metres."

        "When is the position function increasing? When is it decreasing?\nRemember that in calculating the \\emph{total} ~distance means that\ntravelling backwards is still covering distance, therefore adding (not\nsubtracting) to the total distance travelled."
