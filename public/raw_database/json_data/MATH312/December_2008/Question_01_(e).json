        "The statement is \\textbf{false}\n\nWe seek a counter example and we take the smallest composite number for\n\\emph{b}, namely $\\displaystyle b=4$. We then take $\\displaystyle a=3$.\nThen\n\n$\\displaystyle 3^{4-1} \\equiv 3^{3} \\equiv 27 \\equiv 3 \\not\\equiv 1\\mod{4}$.\n\nFor a more enlightening proof, recall that by Euler's Theorem\n\n$\\displaystyle a^{\\phi(b)} \\equiv 1 \\mod{b}$\n\nThus if we find a value of \\emph{b} where\n$\\displaystyle \\gcd(\\phi(b),b-1) = 1$ we would be able to construct a\ncounter example since in this case there are integers \\emph{s} and\n\\emph{t} such that\n\n$\\displaystyle s\\phi(b) + (b-1)t = 1$\n\nand so choosing an \\emph{a} coprime to \\emph{b} between 2 and b-1 would\ngive us that\n\n$\\displaystyle a \\equiv a^{s\\phi(b) + (b-1)t} = (a^{\\phi(b)})^{s}(a^{b-1})^{t} \\equiv 1 \\mod{b}$\n\nwhich would be a contradiction. This is what we did above."
