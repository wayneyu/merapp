    "statement": "You are driving down the highway when you see a sleeping moose. You\napply the brakes and carefully stop your car 20m away from the animal.\nWhile you are looking for your camera the moose wakes up. It instantly\ncharges toward your car at a constant speed of 8m/s. One second later,\nyou start backing away from the moose at a constant acceleration of\n2m/s\\textsuperscript{2}.\n\n\\textbf{(i)} Write down a function \\emph{d(t)} that is the distance from\nyour car to the moose where \\emph{t = 0} indicates the moment when you\nstart backing away.",

        "Let $d(t)$ be the distance between your car and the moose, where \\emph{t\n= 0} represents the time when your car begins backing up. The moose\nbegan charging one second before \\emph{t=0}, i.e. at \\emph{t = -1}, and\nso, when the car begins backing up the moose is 20m-8m/s*(1s) = 12m\naway.\n\nLet the origin be the position of the car at time \\emph{t = 0}. Consider\nthe moose. If the moose is 12m away at \\emph{t = 0} and is moving\ntowards the car at a speed of 8 m/s, we can define the position of the\nmoose as \\emph{m(t)} where\n\n\\[\\displaystyle m(t) = 12 - 8t.\\]\n\nIf we set $c(t)$ be the position of the car at time \\emph{t}. The car is\naccelerating away from the moose at 2 m/s\\textsuperscript{2}, then\n\n\\[\\displaystyle c''(t) = -2 \\quad \\rightarrow \\quad c'(t) = -2t + c_{1}\\]\n\nSince the car is not moving at \\emph{t = 0}, we have that\n$c'(0) = c_{1} = 0$. Thus $c'(t) = -2t$. From this, we obtain that\n$c(t) = -t^{2} + c_{2}$. Since we set the position of the car at \\emph{t\n= 0} to be $c(0) = 0$, then $c(t) = -t^{2}$.\n\nThe distance between the car and the moose is thus\n\n\\[d(t) = c(t) - m(t) \\quad \\rightarrow \\quad {\\color{blue}d(t) = -t^{2} + 8t -12}\\]"

        "First, consider the displacement of the car and the moose separately.\n\nFor example, fix the initial position to be where the car is stopped.\nRelatively to that point, what are the respective distance of the car\nand the moose over time.\n\nThen, you'll find the distance between the car and the moose by taking\nthe difference of those two things."
