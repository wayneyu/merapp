    "sols": [
        "The area of \\emph{T} is half of the area of \\textbf{a} parallelogram\nwith vertices \\emph{(0, 1, 2), (1, 1, 5)} and \\emph{(\u00e2\u0088\u00921, 2, 2)}.\nMeanwhile, the area of a parallelogram is the magnitude of the cross\nproduct of vectors of two adjacent sides.\n\nA convenient choice of vectors representing two adjacent sides are the\nones with common vertex \\emph{(0, 1, 2)}. They are \\emph{(1, 1, 5) - (0,\n1, 2) = (1, 0, 3)} and \\emph{(-1, 2, 2) - (0, 1, 2) = (-1, 1, 0)}\n\nHence,\n\n\\[T = \\frac{1}{2} \\left|(1,0,3) \\times (-1,1,0)\\right| = 1/2 \\left|(-3,-3,1)\\right| = \\frac{\\sqrt{19}}{2}\\]"

        "Don't fall back to the elementary method of calculating base and height.\n\nThere is a linear-algebraic formula for area of parallelogram which you\ncan make use of."
