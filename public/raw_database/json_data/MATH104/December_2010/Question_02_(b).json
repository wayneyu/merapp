        "First note that the difference between the y-coordinates of this point\nand (1,2) is $31/16-2=-1/16$, which is fairly small. It is probably\nsmall enough to use the tangent line from part (a) to find a reasonable\napproximation for the x-coordinate of this point. (We are not asked to\nestimate the error in this approximation.)\n\nThe x-coordinate of the point on the tangent line with y-coordinate\n31/16 can be found by substituting y=31/16 into the equation for the\ntangent line and solving for x.\n\n\\begin{align*}\\frac{31}{16}-2 =  -\\frac{7}{16}(x-1)\\end{align*} Solving for $x$,\n\n\\begin{align*}x =  1-\\frac{16}{7}\\left(\\frac{31}{16}-2\\right) = 1-\\frac{16}{7}\\left(-\\frac{1}{16}\\right) = 1+\\frac{1}{7} = \\frac{8}{7}.\\end{align*}\n\nMaking a linear approximation, we conclude that the point on the\n\\emph{curve} with y-coordinate 31/16 is approximately the same as the\npoint on the \\emph{tangent line} with y-coordinate 31/16.\n\nHence, the x-coordinate of the point on the curve with y-coordinate\n31/16 is approximately 8/7."

        "The graph of the linear approximation near a point on a curve is simply\nthe tangent line to the curve at that point.", 
        "You've already found the equation of the tangent line at the point (1,2)\nin part (a). Is the point on the curve with y-coordinate 31/16 close to\n(1,2)? If so, you can use the tangent line equation from part (a)."
