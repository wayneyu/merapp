        "The formula for the Laplacian matrix L is\\[L = D^{T} R^{-1} D\\]\n\nBut we can simply calculate the Laplacian matrix by computing the\nfollowing:\n\nFor the diagonal entries\n($L_{ii}$)\\[L_{ii} = \\sum_{connected \\ edges, i} \\gamma_{i}\\]\n\nFor the non-diagonal edges\n($L_{ij}$)\\[L_{ij} = \\sum_{shared \\ edges j} \\gamma_{j}\\] if there are\nshared edges and $L_{ij} = 0$ if no shared edges\n\n$\\gamma = \\frac{1}{R}$ Where R is the resistance of the edge. which in\nthis question $R = 1$ so $\\gamma = 1$.\n\nFollowing the equations given above, the Laplacian matrix\nis\\[L = \\begin{bmatrix}\n4 & -1 & -1 & -1 & -1 & 0\\\\ \n-1 & 4 & -1 & 0 & -1 & -1\\\\ \n-1 & -1 & 4 & -1 & 0 & -1\\\\ \n-1& 0 & -1 & 4 & -1 & -1\\\\ \n-1& -1 & 0 & -1 & 4 & -1\\\\ \n0 & -1 & -1 & -1 & -1 & 4\n\\end{bmatrix}\\]\n\nThe columns of matrix L are labeled as node 1 to 6 from left to right.\n\nFINAL ANSWER\n\n$L = \\begin{bmatrix}\n4 & -1 & -1 & -1 & -1 & 0\\\\ \n-1 & 4 & -1 & 0 & -1 & -1\\\\ \n-1 & -1 & 4 & -1 & 0 & -1\\\\ \n-1& 0 & -1 & 4 & -1 & -1\\\\ \n-1& -1 & 0 & -1 & 4 & -1\\\\ \n0 & -1 & -1 & -1 & -1 & 4\n\\end{bmatrix}$"
