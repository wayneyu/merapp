Let \\emph{x}\\textsubscript{1} and\n\\emph{x}\\textsubscript{2} be two points on $(-\\infty,\\infty)$. Prove,\nusing your answer in part\n\\href{Science:Math Exam Resources/Courses/MATH110/April 2012/Question 3 (a)}{(a)},\nthat\n\n\\[\\displaystyle\nf(x_2)-f(x_1) = 0.\\]",

        "If $x_1 = x_2$, the assumption is obviously true, so suppose\n$x_1 \\not = x_2$. Since $f'(x) = 0$ everywhere, we can deduce that $f$\nis differentiable everywhere, and hence also continuous everywhere, in\nparticular on the interval $[x_1, x_2]$. We can then apply the Mean\nValue Theorem, which tells us that there exists some \\emph{c} in the\ninterval $(x_1, x_2)$ such that\n\n\\[f'(c) = \\frac{f(x_2) - f(x_1)}{x_2 - x_1}.\\]\n\nHowever, we know $f'(x) = 0$ everywhere, so $f'(c) = 0$ and we have\n\n\\[0 = \\frac{f(x_2) - f(x_1)}{x_2 - x_1}\\]\n\nand by cross multiplication,\n\n\\[\\displaystyle 0 = f(x_2) - f(x_1).\\]"
