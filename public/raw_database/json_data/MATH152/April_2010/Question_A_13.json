In the first iteration, the entry\n\\emph{A(1,1)} is set to \\emph{-5} and \\emph{A(1,2)} is set to \\emph{1},\nresulting in\n\n\\[A = \\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} {\\color{green} -5} & {\\color{green} 1} & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0\\end{array}\\right]\\]\n\nIn the second iteration the entry \\emph{A(2,2)} is set to \\emph{-5} and\n\\emph{A(2,3)} is set to \\emph{1}, hence\n\n\\[A = \\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} -5 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & {\\color{green} -5} & {\\color{green} 1} \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0\\end{array}\\right]\\]\n\nFinally, the entry \\emph{A(3,3)} is set to \\emph{-2}. So the final\nanswer is\n\n\\[A = \\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} -5 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -5 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -2 \\end{array}\\right]\\]"
