    "statement": "In this problem, you will approximate $\\ln(0.9)$ in two ways: one using\nlinear approximation and the other using quadratic approximation. You\nmay find it useful to draw the graph of $\\ln(x)$ for $x$ near 1 to help\nyou answer some parts of this question.\n\nc) Is your approximation for $\\ln(0.9)$ too large or too small? Explain.\nUse this information together with the error bound found in part (b) to\nconstruct an interval you can guarantee contains the true value of\n$\\ln(0.9)$.",

        "We find the second derivative of f(x)=ln(x),\n\n\\begin{align*}\nf'(x)&=\\frac{1}{x}\\\\\nf''(x)&=-\\frac{1}{x^2}.\n\\end{align*}\n\nBy looking at the sign of the second derivative of the function\n$\\ln(x)$, we see that the function is concave down for all $x$. Thus,\nthe linear approximation is too large. (One can see this visually by\ndrawing a tangent line to the $\\ln(x)$ function at any point on the\ncurve).\n\nSince, we know the linear approximation overestimates the value\n$\\ln(0.9)$, we know that the true value of $\\ln(0.9)$ must lie within\nthe interval:\n\n$\\Big[-0.1 - \\frac{1}{162},-0.1\\Big]$,\n\nwhere we have used our upper bound on the error from part (b) to help\ndefine the lower bound on our interval."
