        "A vector normal to the plain is given by $\\vec{w}_1 \\times \\vec{w}_2$\nwhich is $\\vec{w_1} \\times \\vec{w_2} = \\begin{bmatrix}\n-2\\\\ \n0\\\\ \n2\n\\end{bmatrix}$To find the T matrix we need to find how the basis vectors\n$e_1 = [ 1, 0,0 ], e_2 = [0,1,0], e_3 = [0, 0, 1]$ are transformed.It is easy to see that $e_2 = [0,1,0]$ gets transformed to itself\nbecause it lies on the plane. $e_1$ and $e_3$ are more difficult. For\n$e_1$, imagine that we were looking directly on the x,z plane, the plane\nwould then be squished into the line x = z. Then it is clear that the\nvector $e_1 = [1, 0,0]$ transforms into $[0,0,1]$. Similarly, we can say\nthat $e_3 = [0,0,1]$ transforms into $[1,0,0]$Hence, our transformation matrix is\n$T = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 0 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}$"
