        "The critical points of a function f(x) are all the values $x$ where\n\n{[}1{]} $f'(x)$ = 0\n\n{[}2{]} $f'(x)$ does not exist and $f(x)$ is defined.\n\nFirst, we look at the part of the domain of $f(x)$ where \\emph{x}\n$\\geq$ 1. In this domain:\n\n\\[f(x) = \\frac{4}{\\pi}\\tan^{-1}(x) \\quad \\rightarrow \\quad f'(x) = \\frac{4}{\\pi}\\left(\\frac{1}{1 + x^{2}}\\right).\\]\nWe cannot find any values of \\emph{x} such that the derivative is 0 or\nundefined and hence there are no critical points there.\n\nWe now move on to the part of the domain where \\emph{x} \\textless{} 1:\n\n\\[f(x) = 2 - x^{4} \\quad \\rightarrow \\quad f'(x) = -4x^{3}.\\] Here we\nsee that $f'(x)$ = 0 for \\emph{x} = 0. And since \\emph{x} = 0 is in\nthe part of the domain we are looking at, this is indeed a critical\npoint.\n\nFinally, we need to look at \\emph{x} = 1 and see if the function is\ndifferentiable there (since our piecewise function is split there). So\nwe compute the limit as \\emph{x} approaches 1 on each side. First on the\nleft:\n\n\\[\\lim_{x \\to 1^{-}}f'(x) = \\lim_{x \\to 1^{-}} -4x^3 = -4\\] and on the\nright:\n\n\\[\\lim_{x \\to 1^{+}}f'(x) = \\lim_{x \\to 1^{-}} \\frac{4}{\\pi}\\left(\\frac{1}{1 + x^{2}}\\right) = \\frac{4}{\\pi} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{2}{\\pi}\\]\nSince the left and right limits are different we can conclude that the\nfunction is not differentiable at \\emph{x} = 1, which makes that point a\ncritical point. Therefore \\emph{x} = 0 and \\emph{x} = 1 are the critical\npoints of the function.\n\nTo determine the intervals of increase and decrease we need to take test\npoints of the function on the intervals,\n\n\\[\\displaystyle\n(-\\infty,0),(0,1),(1,\\infty)\\] Plugging a value from each interval of\n\\emph{x} into our expressions for the derivative, we get the following\n\n\\[f'(-1) = 4 > 0, \\quad f'(0.5) = -4(0.5)^3 < 0, \\quad f'(2) = \\frac{4}{5\\pi} > 0\\]\nTherefore, f(x) is increasing on the intervals ($-\\infty$, 0) and (1,\n$+\\infty$) and decreasing on the interval (0, 1). By the first\nderivative test, we can see that the function has a local maximum at\n\\emph{x} = 0 and a local minimum at \\emph{x} = 1.\n\nTherefore the function $f$ has a local max of 2 (at \\emph{x} = 0) and a\nlocal min of 1 (at \\emph{x} = 1)."
