    "statement": "In an experiment involving a bacteria population, $N(t)$ denotes the\nsize of the population (measured in thousands of individuals) as a\nfunction of time, starting at $t=0$. The initial population is\n$N(0) = N_{0}$.\n\nc) What happens to the solution from\n\\href{Science:Math_Exam_Resources/Courses/MATH103/April_2006/Question_07_(b)}{part\n(b)} as $t\\to 1$? Can you find an initial population $N_{0}$ for which\nthis problem doesn't occur for any time \\emph{t}?",
