        "We are trying to find points \\emph{c} in an interval \\emph{(-d, d)} such\nthat $f'(c) = -1$. To begin, we set the derivative (from part (a)) equal\nto -1 and isolate the terms with the variable \\emph{x}.\n\n$\\displaystyle -1 = 1 + 4x\\sin(1/x) - 2\\cos(1/x)$\n\n$\\displaystyle -2 = 4x\\sin(1/x) - 2\\cos(1/x)$\n\n$\\displaystyle -1 = 2x\\sin(1/x) - \\cos(1/x)$\n\nThe question is asking us to find an infinite number of points that\nsatisfy this equation. We now use the information from the hint. If we\ncan find a value of \\emph{x} such that $\\sin(1/x) = 0$, and for the same\nvalue of \\emph{x}, $\\cos(1/x) = 1$, we will have found a solution.\n\nWe already know that $\\sin(x) = 0$ when\n\n$x = 0, \\pm\\pi, \\pm2\\pi, \\pm3\\pi, \\dots$.\n\nSo in order for $\\sin(1/x) = 0$,\n\n$x = \\pm\\frac{1}{\\pi}, \\pm\\frac{1}{2\\pi}, \\pm\\frac{1}{3\\pi}, \\dots$.\n\n(Note that x = 0 cannot be a solution because it makes the function\nundefined.)\n\nThus we have a possible solution of the form\n\n$x = \\frac{1}{n\\pi}$\n\nwhere \\emph{n} is a non-zero integer. For this list of x-values,\n$\\sin(1/x) = 0$. However, we also need $\\cos(1/x) = 1$ in order to\nsatisfy our equation. If we plug our potential solution into the\n$\\cos(1/x)$ function, we get:\n\n$\\cos\\left(\\frac{1}{1/(n\\pi)}\\right) = \\cos(n\\pi)$\n\nThis expression is only equal to 1 if \\emph{n} is even. Thus we must\nmodify our list of solutions to the following:\n\n$x = \\frac{1}{m\\pi}$\n\nWhere \\emph{m} is an even integer (other than zero).\n\nBecause there are an infinite number of even integers, we have found an\ninfinite number of solutions \\emph{c} such that $f'(c) = -1$\n\nThe last part of the question asks us to show that, given an arbitrary\ninterval \\emph{(-d, d)} for $d > 0$, an infinite number of our list of\nsolutions will fall inside that interval. The key to this section of\nthis problem is noticing that our list of solutions is a fraction, and\nas the denominator of the fraction can be arbitrarily large (some\ninteger times pi), it can be arbitrarily close to zero. Thus, no matter\nwhich \\emph{d} is chosen to be the endpoint of our interval, there will\nbe some even integer, say M, such that\n\n$-d < -\\frac{1}{M\\pi} < 0 < \\frac{1}{M\\pi} < d$\n\nAnd for all even \\emph{m} larger than \\emph{M}, the value of\n$\\frac{1}{m\\pi}$ will also fall between -d and d, meaning we have an\ninfinite number of solutions inside the interval (-d, d)."
