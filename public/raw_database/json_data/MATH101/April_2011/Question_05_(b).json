    "statement": "Bird-Bath and Beyond Incorporated is famous for its Quetzal attracting\nbird-feeder solution made from water, honey and cane-sugar.\n\nTo make their solution, both honey and a cane-sugar solution are poured\ninto a 200 L mixing tank. The honey is poured in at a rate of 1 L per\nminute while the sugar solution is poured in at 9 L per minute. Note\nthat 1 L of honey contains 1 kg of sugar, while the cane-sugar solution\ncontains 100g of sugar per L.\n\nUnfortunately today there is a problem with the mixing tank. It was\nthoroughly cleaned and is initially filled with pure water, but main\nvalve was broken and the water cannot be drained. When the mixing\nprocess is started, the honey and sugar-solutions are poured into the\ntank, and the excess fluid flows out of an emergency valve at 10 L per\nminute and onto the floor. You should assume that the solutions mix\nimmediately and thoroughly in the tank.\n\n(b) How much sugar is in the tank after time \\emph{t}?",

        "Recall that the differential equation is given by\n\n\\[\\frac{dS}{dt} = 1.9 - \\frac1{20}S\\]\n\nWe use separation of variables and bring all terms with \\emph{S} to the\nleft hand side, and all terms involving \\emph{t} to the right hand side.\nSo we multiply both sides with $\\displaystyle dt$ and divide by\n$\\displaystyle 1.9 - \\frac1{20}S$:\n\n\\[\\frac{dS}{1.9 - \\frac1{20}S} = dt\\]\n\nLet's now integrate both sides:\n\n\\[\\int \\frac{dS}{1.9 - \\frac1{20}S} = \\int dt\\]\n\nThe integral on the right hand side is simply $\\displaystyle t+C_1.$ To\nsolve the left hand side, use the substitution\n$u = 1.9 - \\frac{1}{20}S,\\ dS=-20\\,du$ and obtain\n\n\\[\\int \\frac{dS}{1.9 - \\frac1{20}S} = \\int \\frac{-20\\,du}{u} = -20 \\ln|u| = -20 \\ln\\left|1.9-\\frac{S}{20}\\right| = t+C_1.\\]\n\nSolving the above for \\emph{S} yields\n\n\\begin{align*}\n-20 \\ln\\left|1.9-\\frac{S}{20}\\right| &= t+C_1 \\\\\n\\ln\\left|1.9-\\frac{S}{20}\\right| &= -\\frac{t}{20}-\\frac{C_1}{20} \\\\\n\\left|1.9-\\frac{S}{20}\\right| &= e^{-\\frac{t}{20}-\\frac{C_1}{20}} \\\\\n1.9-\\frac{S}{20} &= \\pm e^{-\\frac{C_1}{20}} e^{-\\frac{t}{20}}\\\\\nS &= 20\\left(1.9-C_2 e^{-t/20}\\right), \n\\end{align*}\n\nwith a different constant $C_2 = \\pm e^{-C_1/20}$. Now we use the\ninitial condition \\emph{S(0) = 0} to solve for\n\\emph{C\\textsubscript{2}}:\n\n\\[0 = 20\\left(1.9-C_2 e^{0}\\right) = 20(1.9-C_2),\\]\n\nhence \\emph{C\\textsubscript{2} = 1.9} and therefore the final answer is\n\n\\[S(t) = 20\\left(1.9-1.9e^{-t/20}\\right).\\]"
