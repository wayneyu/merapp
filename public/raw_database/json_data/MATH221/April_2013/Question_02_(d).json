        "If we write the system of equations as an extended matrix, it will be\nexactly the matrix \\emph{A}. Thus, thinking of \\emph{A} as an extended\nmatrix, we know it represents 4 equations in 4 variables. Row operations\nlead to an equivalent system of equations, with the same solutions.\nHence we can instead choose the extended matrix \\emph{B}, even better,\nwe can further use the reduced matrix we used in\n\\href{Science:Math_Exam_Resources/Courses/MATH221/April_2013/Question_02_(b)}{part\n(b)}, i.e. the matrix:\n\n$\\left[ \\begin{array}{ccccc}\n1 & 0 & 7 & 0 & -39 \\\\ \n0 & 1 & -3 & 0 & 31 \\\\ \n0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & -7 \\\\ \n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\n\\end{array} \\right]$\n\nto determine the answer. From the above matrix, we can read the\nequations:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n&x + 7z &= -39\\\\\n&y -3z &= 31\\\\\n&w &= -7\\end{align*}\n\nFrom this, we can quickly see that $w = 0$ leads to no solution (i.e. it\nwould lead to saying \\emph{0 = -7}).\n\nIf \\emph{z=0}, then we get the solution\n\n\\begin{align*}\\displaystyle x = -39, \\quad y = 31,\\quad w = -7\\end{align*}"
