        "This is a rational function, so we try partial fractions. The\nintegrand's denominator can be factored, then we apply partial fraction\ndecomposition giving\n\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{dx}{x+x^2} &= \\frac{1}{x(1+x)} \\\\\n& = \\frac{A}{x} + \\frac{B}{1+x}\n\\end{align*}\n\nCross multiplying,\n\n\\begin{align*}\n1 &= A(1+x) + Bx\n\\end{align*}\n\nWe can solve this several ways.\n\n(1) Setting $\\displaystyle x = 0$ we get $\\displaystyle 1 = A$, and\nsetting $\\displaystyle x = -1$ we get $\\displaystyle 1 = -B$, so\n$\\displaystyle B = -1$.\n\n(2) Comparing coefficients of the constant term, we get\n$\\displaystyle 1 = A$, and then comparing coefficients of the\n$\\displaystyle x$ term, we get $\\displaystyle 0 = A+B = 1+B$, so\n$\\displaystyle B = -1$.\n\n(3) We get $\\displaystyle A = 1$ and $\\displaystyle B = -1$ by\ninspection.\n\nNow we solve the integral:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n\\int_1^2 \\frac{dx}{x+x^2} &= \\int_1^2 \\frac{dx}{x(1+x)} \\\\\n&= \\int_1^2 \\left( \\frac1{x} + \\frac{-1}{1+x}\\right)\\,dx \\\\\n&= \\left( \\ln|x| - \\ln|1+x|\\right)\\big|_1^2 \\\\\n&= (\\ln 2 - \\ln 3) - (\\ln 1 - \\ln 2) \\\\\n&= 2\\ln 2 - \\ln 3\n\\end{align*}\n\nThe answer $\\ln \\frac43$ is equivalent."
