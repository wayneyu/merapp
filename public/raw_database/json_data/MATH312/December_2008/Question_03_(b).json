        "Proceeding as in the hints yields\n\n\\begin{align*}\nx &\\equiv -1 \\mod{999}\\\\\nx &\\equiv -1 \\mod{1000}\\\\\nx &\\equiv -1 \\mod{1001}\\end{align*}\n\nAs\n\n\\begin{align*}\n999 &= 3^{3} \\cdot 37\\\\\n1000 &= 2^{3} \\cdot 5^{3}\\\\\n1001 &= 7 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 13\\end{align*}\n\nwe see that all these moduli are coprime. Hence by the Chinese remainder\ntheorem, we have that a unique solution is given by\n\n$\\displaystyle x \\equiv -1 \\mod {999 \\cdot 1000 \\cdot 1001}$\n\nor expanded and made positive\n\n$\\displaystyle x \\equiv 999998999 \\mod {999999000}$"

        "Making two clever observations makes this problem much more tractable.\nFirst notice that the right hand sides are all congruent to\n$\\displaystyle -1$ modulo the numbers on the far right.", 
        "The other observation is that the three moduli on the right are three\nconsecutive pairwise coprime numbers so the Chinese Remainder Theorem\nwill help finish the problem."
