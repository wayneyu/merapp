        "\\textbf{x-intercept}\\[f(x)\\] has an x-intercept when $f(x) = 0$. So\n\n\\[0 = \\frac{2x^2}{x^2-1}\\]\n\nCross multiplying gives $2x^2 = 0$, which simplifies to $x = 0$. So the\nx-intercept is $(0,0)$\n\n\\textbf{y-intercept}\\[f(x)\\] has an y-intercept when $x = 0$. Plugging\nin \\emph{x = 0} gives $f(0) = 0$.\n\nSo the y-intercept is the same as the x-intercept, $(0,0)$"
