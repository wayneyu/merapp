The scanner has a probability $\\displaystyle q = 0.001$ of\nfailure when the technician turns it on in the morning. (Assume that if\nit turns on, it will not fail later that day i.e. treat this as a\n\\textbf{discrete} event. Also assume that failure is independent of age\nor history of the machine.)\n\n(a) What is the probability that the machine will work on days 1 to\n$\\displaystyle k-1$ and then fail on day \\emph{k}?",
