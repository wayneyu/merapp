        "First, we are of course interested in the values of the function at\n\\emph{x} = -4 and \\emph{x} = 4. We have:\n\n\\begin{align*}\nf(-4) &= (-4)^3 - 15(-4) + 1 = -64 +60 + 1 = -3 \\\\\nf(4) &= 4^3 - 15\\cdot 4 + 1 = 64 - 60 + 1 = 5 \\end{align*}\n\nSo, using the Intermediate Value Theorem (since this polynomial is\nclearly continuous everywhere) we can guarantee the existence of one\nroot. But not three.\n\nTo show there are three roots, we need to show that this cubic\npolynomial crosses the \\emph{x}-axis again. If we just find the local\nextrema (if there are three roots, there should be one local maximum\nfollowed by one local minimum) and show that they are in our interval,\nwe could refine our use of the Intermdeiate Value Theorem.\n\nLet's find out where these extrema are. First, we compute the derivative\nof the function $f$:\n\n\\begin{align*}\\displaystyle\nf'(x) = 3x^2-15\\end{align*} And then find out the critical points:\n\n\\begin{align*}\\displaystyle\nf'(x) = 0 \\iff 3x^2-15=0 \\iff x^2 = 5 \\iff x = \\pm \\sqrt{5}\\end{align*}\n\nWe actually only need to know what is the value of the function $f$ at\nthese two points:\n\n\\begin{align*}\nf(-\\sqrt{5}) = -5\\sqrt{5} + 15\\sqrt{5} + 1 = 5\\sqrt{5} + 1 > 0 \\\\\nf(\\sqrt{5}) = 5 \\sqrt{5} - 15\\sqrt{5} + 1 = -10 \\sqrt{5} + 1 < 0\\end{align*} (If you are not sure how we know that the second value is\nnegative, consider that \\textgreater{} 2 so -10 \\textless{} -20).\n\nSo we can now apply the Intermediate Value Theorem three times, on the\nintervals {[}-4, -{]}, {[}-, {]} and {[}, 4{]}{]} to show that there\nmust be a root in each of these intervals.\n\nNote that we need not use these intervals precisely. As long as you can\nidentify three intervals similar to the ones above, i.e.\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\itemsep1pt\\parskip0pt\\parsep0pt\n\\item\n  The three intervals are contained in {[}-4,4{]}.\n\\item\n  The three intervals don't overlap.\n\\item\n  If for one endpoint of an interval, $f > 0$ then for the other\n  endpoint, $f < 0$.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\nThen you can use the intermediate value theorem in the same way as\ndescribed above to show there is a root in each interval."
