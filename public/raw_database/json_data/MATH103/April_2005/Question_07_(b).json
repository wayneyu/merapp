    "statement": "Cholera is a disease that can spread through untreated sewage polluting\nthe drinking water supply. Let $\\displaystyle y(t)$ be the fraction of\npeople in a population who have the disease at time \\emph{t}. Assume\nthat in a certain city, the fraction of people who have the disease\nincreases at a rate proportional to the fraction of people who do not\nyet have the disease. (We will use $\\displaystyle k > 0$ as the constant\nof proportionality).\n\n(b) Solve this differential equation, assuming that at time\n$\\displaystyle t=0$ the fraction of people who have the disease is\n$\\displaystyle y(0) = y_{0}$ where $\\displaystyle 0 \\leq y_{0} \\leq 1$",
