        "To determine where \\emph{f\"(x)=0}, we look at the numerator of\n\\emph{f\"(x)} and note that \\emph{f\"(x)=0} when the numerator is zero,\ni.e.\n\n\\[2x(x^2+9)=0.\\] Since \\emph{x\\textsuperscript{2}+9=0} has no real\nsolutions, the only value of \\emph{x} that satisfies the above equation\nis when \\emph{x=0}.\n\nTo determine where \\emph{f\"(x)} does not exist, we set the denominator\nto 0, i.e.\n\n\\[x^2-3=0.\\] So, \\emph{f\"(x)} does not exist when $x=\\pm\\sqrt 3$.\n\n''Remark: Note that the denominator and numerator are never\nsimultaneously 0. If they were, say at \\emph{x=a}, we would have to take\nthe limit of \\emph{f\"(x)} as $x \\rightarrow a$ to determine if\n\\emph{f\"(x)} did not exist or was zero (or another finite number).''"
