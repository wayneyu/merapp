        "The first step to solve this problem is to understand what volume we are\ntrying to compute.\n\nThe question states that there is a region bounded by the curves\n\\emph{y}=5 and \\emph{y}=\\emph{x}+4/\\emph{x}. For large values of\n\\emph{x} the second curve looks like the line \\emph{y}=\\emph{x}, but\nthere is also a vertical asymptote at \\emph{x}=0. So it seems that it\nwill indeed cross the horizontal line \\emph{y}=5 twice (as it dips down\nbefore going back up). We can compute where the intersections are by\nsolving:\n\n\\[x+\\frac{4}{x} = 5\\] which is equivalent to\n\n\\[\\displaystyle\n0 = x^2-5x+4 = (x-1)(x-4)\\] and has solutions \\emph{x}=1 and \\emph{x}=4.\nThen we want to know how far down the curve goes, so we look for its\nlocal minimum. We compute its derivative:\n\n\\[\\frac{d}{dx}\\left(x+\\frac{4}{x}\\right) = 1 - \\frac{4}{x^2}\\] and hence\nsee that it has two critical points, one at \\emph{x}=-2 and one at\n\\emph{x}=2.

The distance from\n\\emph{x} to \\emph{x}=-1 is the radius of the cylindrical shell and is\n\\emph{r}=\\emph{x}+1. The height of the function at this point is the\ndifference of the top function \\emph{y}=5 to the bottom function\n\\emph{y}=\\emph{x}+4/\\emph{x} which is 5-\\emph{x}-4/\\emph{x}. When we\nrotate, we travel a distance of $2\\pi r$ (the circumference) and we are\nmultiplying by $h\\Delta x$. Thus, we have\n\n\\begin{align*}\nV &= \\int_{1}^{4}2\\pi(x+1)(5-x-4/x)\\,dx \\\\\n&= 2\\pi\\int_{1}^{4}(5x-x^{2}-4 + 5-x-4/x)\\,dx \\\\\n&= 2\\pi\\int_{1}^{4}(-x^{2}+4x +1-4/x)\\,dx \\\\\n&= 2\\pi(-x^{3}/3 + 2x^{2} + x - 4\\ln|x|)\\bigg|_{1}^{4} \\\\\n&= 2\\pi((-(4)^{3}/3 + 2(4)^{2} + 4 - 4\\ln|4|) - (-(1)^{3}/3 + 2(1)^{2} + 1 - 4\\ln|1|))\\\\\n&= 2\\pi((-64/3 + 32 + 4 - 4\\ln|4|) - (-1/3 + 2 + 1 -0))\\\\\n&= 2\\pi(12 -4\\ln|4|)\\\\\n&= 2\\pi(12 -8\\ln(2))\\\\\n&= 8\\pi(3 -2\\ln(2)) \\\\\n&= 24\\pi - 16\\pi \\ln(2)\n\\end{align*}\n\nWhere each of the last four answers are equivalent and would be accepted\nas a final answer.", 
        "The first step to solve this problem is to understand what volume we are\ntrying to compute.\n\nThe question states that there is a region delimited by the curves\n\\emph{y}=5 and \\emph{y}=\\emph{x}+4/\\emph{x}.

We will compute the area of that slice\n(the difference of area between the outer disk and the inner disk) and\nintegrate.\n\nThe outer disc has a radius that starts at the point (2,4) and moves\nright towards the point (4,5) following the curve\n\\emph{y}=\\emph{x}+4/\\emph{x}. The inner disc has a radius that starts at\nthe point (2,4) and moves left towards the point (1,5) following the\nother side of the curve. We need to compute that radius (starting at\nx=-1). For this, the first step is to express the curve in terms of\n\\emph{y} instead of \\emph{x}:\n\n\\begin{align*}\ny=x+\\frac{4}{x} &\\iff yx=x^2+4\\\\\n& \\iff x^2-yx+4=0\\\\\n& \\iff x=\\frac{y \\pm \\sqrt{y^2-16}}{2}\n\\end{align*} If we look at this, it makes sense: This is only well\ndefined if \\emph{y} is larger than 4 (see on the graph) and there are\ntwo components: the one with the + for the right side and the one with\nthe - for the left side. Since the axis of rotation is at \\emph{x}=-1,\nwe need to add 1 to each of the radius and obtain:\n\n\\begin{align*}\nr_{outer}(y) &= 1+\\frac{y + \\sqrt{y^2-16}}{2}\\\\\nr_{inner}(y) &= 1+\\frac{y - \\sqrt{y^2-16}}{2}\n\\end{align*} And so we can write the volume by integrating over all the\nshells, which are obtained by taking the difference of the outer and\ninner disk:\n\n\\[V = \\int_4^5 \\left( \\pi \\left( 1+\\frac{y}{2} + \\frac{\\sqrt{y^2-16}}{2}\\right)^2 - \\pi \\left( 1+\\frac{y}{2} - \\frac{\\sqrt{y^2-16}}{2}\\right)^2 \\right) \\,dy\\]\n(since the area of a disk of radius \\emph{r} is $\\pi$\nr\\textsuperscript{2}).\n\nNow we can do some algebra to rewrite this integral into something\neasier to handle. Notice the pattern here\n\n\\[\\displaystyle\n(A+B)^2 - (A-B)^2 = 4AB\\] Hence we can rewrite this as\n\n\\begin{align*}\nV &= \\pi \\int_4^5 4(1+\\frac{y}{2})(\\frac{\\sqrt{y^2-16}}{2}) \\,dy\\\\\n&= \\pi \\int_4^5 (2+y)(\\sqrt{y^2-16}) \\,dy\\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\nNow we need to compute that integral to obtain the desired volume.\nUnfortunately, this won't be straightforward since (2+\\emph{y}) isn't a\nmultiple of the derivative of what is in the square root. There are many\nways to compute this integral, here we will split it in 2 and deal with\neach term.\n\n\\[V = \\pi \\int_4^5 2\\sqrt{y^2-16} \\,dy + \\pi \\int_4^5 y\\sqrt{y^2-16} \\,dy\\]\nLet us call the first integral V\\textsubscript{1} and the second one\nV\\textsubscript{2}. The first one is the tougher one. Indeed:\n\n\\begin{align*}\nV_2 &= \\pi \\int_4^5 y\\sqrt{y^2-16} \\,dy \\\\\n&= \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\int_4^5 2y\\sqrt{y^2-16} \\,dy \\\\\n&= \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\left[ \\frac{2}{3}(y^2-16)^{3/2} \\right]_4^5 \\\\\n&= \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\frac{2}{3} (25-16)^{3/2} \\\\\n&= \\frac{\\pi}{3} \\cdot 27 \\\\\n&= 9\\pi\n\\end{align*}\n\nThe first integral is actually quite complicated. At the same time it is\na classic. As of today (2012) you are not expected to be able to\nintegrate this by hand and/or know the formula from memory. For\ncompletion sake, here is the formula:\n\n\\[\\int \\sqrt{x^2-a^2} \\,dx = \\frac{x}{2} \\sqrt{x^2-a^2} - \\frac{a^2}{2} \\ln( x+ \\sqrt{x^2-a^2}) + c\\]\nWhich in this case gives us:\n\n\\begin{align*}\nV_1 &= \\pi \\int_4^5 2\\sqrt{y^2-16} \\,dy \\\\\n&= 2\\pi \\left[ \\frac{y}{2} \\sqrt{y^2-16} - 8 \\ln( y+ \\sqrt{y^2-16}) \\right]_4^5 \\\\\n&= 2\\pi \\left[ (\\frac{5}{2} \\sqrt{9} - 8 \\ln( 5 + \\sqrt{9} ) - (0 - 8 \\ln( 4 + 0)) \\right] \\\\\n&= 2\\pi (\\frac{15}{2} - 8 \\ln(8) + 8\\ln(4) \\\\\n&= \\pi (15 - 48 \\ln(2) + 32 \\ln(2) ) \\\\\n&= \\pi (15 - 16\\ln(2))\n\\end{align*}\n\nSumming $\\displaystyle V = V_{1} + V_{2}$ gives\n$\\displaystyle V = 24\\pi - 16\\pi\\ln(2)$ which is the same as above.\n\n... This is why using the correct method of solids of revolution is very\nimportant."
