Simplify your answer as much as possible\nand show your work.}\n\nLet $\\displaystyle f(x) = \\begin{cases}\ncx^2 + 3 & \\text{if } x \\geq 1 \\\\\n2x^3 - c & \\text{if } x < 1\n\\end{cases}$\n\nwhere \\emph{c} is a constant.

        "We are concerned with the continuity of $f$ only at $x=1$, though we\nneed not be concerned about whether $f(1)$ is defined or not, since its\npolynomial 'pieces' are defined on $(-\\infty, \\infty)$. It remains to\nfind a $c$ such that\n$\\lim_{x \\to 1} f(x) = \\lim_{x \\to 1^-} f(x) = \\lim_{x \\to 1^+} f(x) = f(1)$.\n\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\itemsep1pt\\parskip0pt\\parsep0pt\n\\item\n  By the definition of $\\displaystyle f(x)$ we have\n  $f(1) = \\lim_{x \\to 1^+} f(x) = \\lim_{x \\to 1^+} cx^2 + 3 = c+3$.\n\\item\n  Furthermore,\n  $\\lim_{x \\to 1^-} f(x) = \\lim_{x \\to 1^-} 2x^3 - c = 2-c$.\n\\end{itemize}\n\nHence we need to find a $\\displaystyle c$ such that\n$\\displaystyle 2 - c = c + 3$. It follows that the value\n$\\displaystyle c$ that makes $\\displaystyle f(x)$ continuous on\n$(-\\infty, \\infty)$ is $c = {\\color{blue}\\frac{-1}{2}}$."
