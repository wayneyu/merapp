        "The function $f(x)$ consists of one function dividing another. This\nmeans we should use the quotient rule to find the derivative.\n\nChanging $\\sqrt{x}$ to $x^{\\frac12}$, and applying the quotient rule we\nget:\n\n\\begin{align*}\nf'(x) & = \\frac{(x^{\\frac12} )'\\cos x - x^{\\frac12}(\\cos x)'}{\\cos^2 x} \\\\\n & = \\frac{\\frac12x^{-\\frac12}\\cos x - x^{\\frac12}(-\\sin x)}{\\cos^2 x} \\\\\n & = \\frac{\\frac{\\cos x}{2\\sqrt{x}} + \\sqrt{x}\\sin x}{\\cos^2 x}\n\\end{align*}\n\nThis answer is sufficient, however, we can simplify this term by\nmultiplying the numerator and the denominator by $2\\sqrt{x}$ to get\n\n\\begin{align*}\n= \\frac{\\cos x+ 2x \\sin x}{2\\sqrt{x} \\cos^2 x}\n\\end{align*}"
