        "Bringing the $y'$ term over we have\n\n$\\displaystyle 4y'' = -y'$\n\nIntegrating both sides yields\n\n$\\displaystyle 4y' = -y + C$\n\nNow, bring the \\emph{y} term to the left and dividing by $\\frac{1}{4}$,\nwe have\n\n$y' + \\frac{y}{4} = \\frac{C}{4}$\n\nNow, multiplying both sides by $e^{x/4}$ yields\n\n$e^{x/4}y' + e^{x/4}\\frac{y}{4} =  e^{x/4}\\frac{C}{4}$\n\nThe left hand side is now a product rule derivative, namely\n\n$(e^{x/4}y)' =  e^{x/4}\\frac{C}{4}$\n\nIntegrating both sides yields\n\n$e^{x/4}y  =  \\int e^{x/4}\\frac{C}{4} \\, dx = e^{x/4}C + D$\n\nDividing both sides by $e^{x/4}$ gives\n\n$\\displaystyle y  = C + De^{-x/4}$\n\ncompleting the question."

        "Try bringing the $y'$ term over first. Then integrating both sides once\nis easy.", 
        "Next, try an integrating factor.", 
        "Multiply both sides by $e^{x/4}$. Then integrate."
