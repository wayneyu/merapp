        "Again using the Disc Method, this time we are rotating around the\ny-axis. Because \\emph{A} runs along the y-axis, this means that the\ninner radius of the disc will be 0. The outer radius of the disc will be\ngiven by first the line \\emph{x = y}, and then by the circle, which,\nwhen solved for \\emph{x} is given by $x = \\sqrt{1 - y^2}$. The first\nradius, \\emph{x = y} will apply from \\emph{y = 0} until the intersection\npoint of the line and the circle. The second radius,\n$x = \\sqrt{1 - y^2}$ will apply from the intersection point to \\emph{y =\n1}.\n\nTo find the intersection point of the line and circle, we use the same\nprocess as the previous question, setting the two equations equal to\neach other and solving for \\emph{y}. In this case, the intersection\npoint will be at $y = \\frac1{\\sqrt{2}}$.\n\nWe now have all the pieces we need to set up the integral and solve, as\nfollows.\n\n\\begin{align*}\n  V &= \\int_0^{\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}} \\pi y^2 dy + \\int_{\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}}^1 \\pi \\left(\\sqrt{1-y^2}\\right)^2 \\,dy \\\\\n  &= \\int_0^{\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}} \\pi y^2 dy + \\pi \\int_{\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}}^1 1-y^2 \\,dy \\\\\n  &= \\pi \\left[\\frac{y^3}{3}\\right|_0^{\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}} + \\pi \\left[y-\\frac{y^3}{3}\\right|_{\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}}^1 \\\\\n  &= \\pi \\left[\\frac{\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)^3}{3}\\right] + \\pi \\left[1-\\frac{1^3}{3}-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}+\\frac{\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)^3}{3}\\right] \\\\\n  &= \\frac{\\pi}{6\\sqrt{2}} + \\pi \\left[\\frac{3}{3}-\\frac{1}{3}-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}+\\frac{1}{6\\sqrt{2}}\\right] \\\\\n  &= \\frac{\\pi}{6\\sqrt{2}} + \\pi \\left[\\frac{6\\sqrt{2}-2\\sqrt{2}-6+1}{6\\sqrt{2}}\\right] \\\\\n  &= \\pi\\left[\\frac{1}{6\\sqrt{2}} + \\frac{4\\sqrt{2}-5}{6\\sqrt{2}}\\right] \\\\\n  &= 2\\pi\\left[\\frac{\\sqrt{2}-1}{3\\sqrt{2}}\\right] \\\\\n  &= \\pi\\left[\\frac{2-\\sqrt{2}}{3}\\right]\\end{align*}", 
        "We can use the shell method to calculate the volume of this solid of\nrevolution as well. If you don't know the shell method, don't worry\nabout understanding this solution. Since we are using the shell method,\nwe should integrate in the x-variable. The integral should be of the\nform\n\n\\begin{align*}\n2 \\pi \\int_a^b x (f(x) - g(x)) dx\\end{align*}\n\nwhere a is the smallest x-value in the region (which will be zero), b is\nthe largest x-value in the region (which was calculated in\n\\href{http://wiki.ubc.ca/Science:Math_Exam_Resources/Courses/MATH103/April_2012/Question_3_\\%28a\\%29}{Problem\n3a} to be $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$), f(x) is the largest y-value in the\nregion at x (which will correspond to the top of each cylindrical\nshell), and g(x) is the smallest y-value in the region at x (which will\ncorrespond to the bottom of each cylindrical shell). So the volume is\n\n\\begin{align*}\n&2 \\pi \\int_0^{\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}} [x  ( \\sqrt{1-x^2} - x)] dx \\\\\n&= 2 \\pi \\int_0^{\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}} [x \\sqrt{1 - x^2}] dx - 2 \\pi \\int_0^{\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}} [x^2] dx\\end{align*} We now use a u-substitution u= 1 - x\\^{}2 in the first\nintegral, and evaluate the second integral directly.\n\n\\begin{align*}\n&=  \\pi \\int_{\\frac{1}{2}}^1 [\\sqrt{u}] du - 2 \\pi \\frac{1}{3 \\sqrt{2}^3} \\\\\n&= \\frac{2\\pi}{3} \\left[u^{3/2}\\right]_{\\frac{1}{2}}^1 - \\frac{2 \\pi}{6 \\sqrt{2}} \\\\\n&= \\frac{2 \\pi}{3} - \\frac{2 \\pi}{3 \\sqrt{2}^3} - \\frac{2 \\pi}{6 \\sqrt{2}} \\\\\n&= \\frac{2 \\pi}{3} - \\frac{2 \\pi}{3 \\sqrt{2}} \\\\\n&= \\pi \\left[ \\frac{2 - \\sqrt{2}}{3} \\right].\\end{align*}"

        "This problem can be done using either the disc method or the shell\nmethod. If you want to use the disc method, since we're rotating around\nthe y-axis, we should be integrating in the y-variable.\n\nThe integral should be of the form\n\n\\begin{align*}\n\\pi \\int_a^b [g(y)^2 - f(y)^2] dy \\end{align*} where a is the smallest y-value in the region, b is the\nlargest y-value in the region, g(y) is the largest x-value in the region\nat y, and f(y) is the smallest y-value in the region at y. Note that\nhere, a is 0, b is 1, and f(y) = 0. g(y) is a piecewise function. Let p\nbe the y-value of the point where the circle $x^2 + y^2  = 1$ and the\nline $x = y$ intersect. Then from 0 to p, g(y) is given by y, and from p\nto 1, g(y) is given by $\\sqrt{1 - x^2}$. So try to find p and evaluate\nthe integral."
