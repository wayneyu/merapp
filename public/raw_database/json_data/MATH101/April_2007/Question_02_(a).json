        "A picture is included below.\n\nFirst, we determine the points of intersection. Setting the two curves\nequal to each other, we have\n\n\\begin{align*}4-x^{2} = (x-2)^{2} = x^{2}-4x + 4\\end{align*}\n\nBringing the terms to the right hand side, we have\n\n\\begin{align*}0 = 2x^{2}-4x = 2x(x-2)\\end{align*}\n\nand so the points of intersection are $x = 0$ and $x=2$. Notice either\nform the picture or testing a point between 0 and 2 (say $x=1$) and\nplugging it into both equations, we see that the curve $4-x^{2}$ is\nbigger between 0 and 2. Hence, our area is\n\n\\begin{align*}\n\\int_{0}^{2} (4-x^{2} - (x-2)^{2})\\, dx &= \\int_{0}^{2} (4-x^{2} - x^{2} + 4x - 4)\\, dx \\\\\n&= \\int_{0}^{2} (-2x^{2} + 4x)\\, dx \\\\\n&= \\left. \\frac{-2x^{3}}{3} + 2x^{2}\\right|_{0}^{2} \\\\\n&= \\frac{-2(2)^{3}}{3} + 2(2)^{2}\\\\\n&= \\frac{8}{3}\\end{align*}\n\ncompleting the question.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htbp]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=.5\\textwidth]{MATH101Apr2007Q2a.jpeg}\n\\caption{MATH101Apr2007Q2a.jpeg}\n\\end{figure}"
