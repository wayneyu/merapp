        "\\textbf{This is the proof as I worked it out, \\emph{Solution 2} presents\nit as you can polish it and write it nicely to impress your teacher or\nnerdy friends.}\n\nI fix myself an $\\epsilon > 0$, that means, it's as if I have a fixed\nvalue in my mind like $\\epsilon = 0.01$. I need to show that if $n$ is\nlarge enough (that is, larger than some number I call $N_\\epsilon$) then\nI will have that the term $a_n$ is $\\epsilon$-close to my number\n\\emph{L} (which here I'm already told should be 1). In other words, if\n$n$ is large enough, then I should have\n\n\\[\\displaystyle\n|a_n - 1| < \\epsilon\\]\n\nHere I know the sequence really well, I'm told that\n\n\\[a_n = \\frac{n^2+3n+1}{n^2}\\]\n\nSo I can rewrite the not-so-good-looking term $|a_n - 1|$\u00c2~into\nsomething much more presentable by using a little algebra:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n|a_n - 1| &= \\left| \\frac{n^2+3n+1}{n^2} - 1 \\right|\\\\\n&=\\left| \\frac{n^2+3n+1}{n^2} - \\frac{n^2}{n^2} \\right|\\\\\n&= \\left| \\frac{n^2+3n+1-n^2}{n^2} \\right|\\\\\n&= \\left| \\frac{3n+1}{n^2} \\right|\\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\nAnd since $n$ is a positive integer, the above fraction is clearly\nalways positive so the absolute value is here totally useless. So I'll\nrewrite\n\n\\[|a_n - 1| = \\frac{3n+1}{n^2}\\]\n\nNow it seems indeed that I can make this as small as I want as long as\n$n$ is large enough. I still need to be precise about this and\nexplicitly guarantee how big $n$ has to be for the term $|a_n -1|$\u00c2~to\nbe less than $\\epsilon$. Here are two ways to do this:\n\n\\textbf{First way:} I can brutally solve\n\n\\[\\frac{3n+1}{n^2} < \\epsilon\\] It gives me\n\n\\[\\displaystyle\n3n+1 < \\epsilon n^2\\] which I can rewrite as\n\n\\[\\displaystyle\n0<\\epsilon n^2 -3n-1\\] Now since $\\epsilon$ is some fixed number, the\nabove is just a quadratic equation (something like $\\epsilon x^2-3x-1$\nwith an ugly coefficient in front of the $x^2$ term). And since it\ncorresponds to a positive parabola (I like to think them as\n\\emph{smiling} parabolas) I know for sure that it will be positive\n(above the \\emph{x}-axis) for any value larger than its second\n\\emph{x}-intercept (if there are any \\emph{x}-intercepts). The\n\\emph{x}-intercepts are the solutions of the\nequation\u00c2~$\\epsilon x^2 - 3x -1=0$ so using the quadratic formula I find\n\n\\[x = \\frac{3 \\pm \\sqrt{9+4\\epsilon}}{2\\epsilon}\\] The larger solution\nhas to be the one using the \"+\" sign, so I get that\n\n\\[0<\\epsilon n^2 -3n-1 \\quad\\text{if}\\quad n > \\frac{3 + \\sqrt{9+4\\epsilon}}{2\\epsilon}\\]\nWhich is my $N_\\epsilon$. You can try for yourself, if you chose\n$\\epsilon = 0.01$ then the above gives me $N = 300.33$ and for any value\nof $n$ larger than 301 you can see that $(3n+1)/n^2$\\textless{} 0.01.\n\n\\textbf{Second way:} as so often in math, there is another way that is\neasier, but involves being a little bit more smart about all this. Since\nI don't care that the value of $N_\\epsilon$ is the best possible, just\none that works, I can do the following manipulation\n\n\\[\\frac{3n+1}{n^2} = \\frac{3}{n} + \\frac{1}{n^2}\\] And now since $n$\u00c2~is\nsome positive integer, it is always true that $n < n^2$ and hence\n\n\\[\\frac{1}{n^2}\u00c2\u00a0< \\frac{1}{n}\\] Hence\n\n\\[\\frac{3}{n} + \\frac{1}{n^2} < \\frac{3}{n} + \\frac{1}{n} = \\frac{4}{n}\\]\nAnd so we get something much simpler to deal with\n\n\\[|a_n - 1| = \\frac{3n+1}{n^2} < \\frac{4}{n}\\]\n\nAnd so now we just wonder when is it true that\n\n\\[\\frac{4}{n} < \\epsilon\\] well... clearly when\n\n\\[\\frac{4}{\\epsilon} < n\\]\n\nAnd so for the value $N_\\epsilon = 4/\\epsilon$ we can guarantee the\nconvergence of the sequence. You can again verify this for yourself that\nif you chose a value $\\epsilon=0.01$ then you will get here\n$N=400$\u00c2~which we know from the above work is way large enough to\nguarantee that for any value of $n$\u00c2~larger than that, we have\n$|a_n-1| < 0.01$. In other words this is much simpler, we just lost some\nprecision on how big the number $N_\\epsilon$ has to be, but to prove\nconvergence, we really don't care so we might as well make our life\neasier.\n\n\\textbf{Note:} this was the work done \\emph{as you go}, which\ncorresponds to how you would find out how to prove that the given\nsequence converges. Now that we have done that work, we can do like\nfancy mathematicians and present our work more nicely and concisely. To\nsee that, check out \\textbf{\\emph{Solution 2}}.", 
        "This is the \\emph{polished} proof that we obtained in\n\\textbf{\\emph{Solution 1}} and resembles more what mathematicians\npresent in books.\n\nFix a value of $\\epsilon >0$ and let\n\n\\[N_\\epsilon = \\frac{4}{\\epsilon}\\]\n\nThen, if $n >\u00c2\u00a0N_\\epsilon$ it holds that\n\n\\begin{align*}\n|a_n-1| &= \\left| \\frac{n^2+3n+1}{n^2}-1\\right|\\\\\n&= \\frac{3n+1}{n^2}\\\\\n&= \\frac{3}{n}\u00c2\u00a0+ \\frac{1}{n^2}\\\\\n&< \\frac{3}{n} + \\frac{1}{n}\\\\\n&= \\frac{4}{n}\\\\\n&< \\frac{4}{N_\\epsilon}\\\\\n&< \\epsilon\n\\end{align*}\n\nwhich concludes our proof."
