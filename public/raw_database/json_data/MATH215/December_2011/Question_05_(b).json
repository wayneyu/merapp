We could then invert this using the convolution identity\n\n:&lt;math>\n\\mathcal{L}^{-1}(F(s)G(s))=\\int_0^tf(t-\\tau)g(t)dt.\n&lt;/math>\n\nWhile this is valid, it could lead to confusion since f(t) is piecewise defined and so we would have to be careful about the different cases that come out of the integration.  Another way we can do the inversion is to include the 1/s terms in F(s) along with the other linear terms in the denominator of G(s).  In this way we write\n\n:&lt;math>\n\\frac{F(s)}{(s-3)(s-2)}=\\frac{\\pi\\left(2\\exp(-s)-\\exp(-2s)\\right)}{s(s-3)(s-2)}=2\\pi\\exp(-s)G(s)-\\pi\\exp(-2s)G(s)\n&lt;/math>\n\nwhere we now define\n\n:&lt;math>\nG(s)=\\frac{1}{s(s-3)(s-2)}.\n&lt;/math>\n\nThe advantage of this form is that the table at the end of the exam lists\n\n:&lt;math>\n\\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\left(\\exp(-cs)F(s)\\right)=u_c(t)f(t-c)\n&lt;/math>\n\nwhere u_c is the Heaviside function defined as\n\n:&lt;math>\nu_c=\n\\begin{cases}\n0,&amp;t&lt;c\\\\\n1,&amp;t\\geq{}c\n\\end{cases}.\n&lt;/math>\n\nWe can use this identity if we once again write G(s) using partial fraction decomposition.  Doing this we get\n\n:&lt;math>\nG(s)=\\frac{1}{s(s-3)(s-2)}=\\frac{1}{6s}+\\frac{1}{3(s-3)}-\\frac{1}{2(s-2)}.\n&lt;/math>\n\nWe can now return to the full problem and actually compute the various inverse Laplace transforms using these identities.\n\n:&lt;math>\n\\begin{align}\ny(t)=\\mathcal{L}^{-1}(Y(s))&amp;=\\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\left(\\frac{F(s)}{(s-3)(s-2)}\\right)+\\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\left(\\frac{s-5}{(s-3)(s-2)}\\right)\\\\\n&amp;=2\\pi\\mathcal{L}^{-1}(\\exp(-s)G(s))-\\pi\\mathcal{L}^{-1}(\\exp(-2s)G(s))+3\\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\left(\\frac{1}{s-2}\\right)-2\\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\left(\\frac{1}{s-3}\\right)\\\\\n&amp;=2\\pi{}u_1g(t-1)-\\pi{}u_2g(t-2)+3\\exp(2t)-2\\exp(3t)\n\\end{align}\n&lt;/math>\n\nwhere\n\n:&lt;math>\ng(t)=\\mathcal{L}^{-1}G(s)=\\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\left(\\frac{1}{6s}+\\frac{1}{3(s-3)}-\\frac{1}{2(s-2)}\\right)=\\frac{1}{6}+\\frac{1}{3}\\exp(3t)-\\frac{1}{2}\\exp(2t).\n&lt;/math>\n\n'''Notes:'''\n\nHad we decided to use the convolution identity we would get the same results, we would just have to either explicitly write down the different cases or we would need to independently identify the different Heaviside functions that are appearing.\n\n\nThere are two handy things we can confirm to at least give us some confidence in our solution.  Firstly, if we substitute in t=0 then we can easily see that both of the initial conditions are satisfied.  Secondly, if t&lt;1 then the source term f(t) contributes nothing and so we have\n\n:&lt;math>\n\\displaystyle{}y(t)=3\\exp(2t)-2\\exp(3t)\n&lt;/math>\n\nwhich we can verify, by direct substitution or otherwise, solves the homogeneous problem.\n\nFinally, if reading the Heaviside notation is awkward, we present the final solution in terms of cases:\n\n:&lt;math>\ny(t)=\n\\begin{cases}\n3\\exp(2t)-2\\exp(3t),&amp;t&lt;1\\\\\n\\frac{\\pi}{3}+\\frac{2\\pi}{3}\\exp(3(t-1))-\\pi\\exp(2(t-1))+3\\exp(2t)-2\\exp(3t),&amp;1\\leq{}t&lt;2\\\\\n\\frac{\\pi}{6}+\\frac{2\\pi}{3}\\exp(3(t-1))-\\pi\\exp(2(t-1))-\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\exp(3(t-2))+\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\exp(2(t-2))+3\\exp(2t)-2\\exp(3t),&amp;t\\geq{}2\n\\end{cases}.\n&lt;/math>\n"
