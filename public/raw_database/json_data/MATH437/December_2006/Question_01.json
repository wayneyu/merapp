        "By the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, let\n$\\displaystyle z^{2} = \\prod_{i=1}^{n}p_{i}^{2\\alpha_{i}}$ be the prime\nfactorization. Suppose that $\\displaystyle p_{i} \\mid  x$ for any\n\\emph{i}. Then since \\emph{x} and \\emph{y} are coprime, this means that\n$\\displaystyle p_{i} \\nmid y$. Thus, we must have that\n$\\displaystyle p_{i} ^{2\\alpha_{i}} \\parallel x$.\n\nIf one of \\emph{x} or \\emph{y} (or both) has no prime factors, then\nsince these numbers are positive, they must be equal to 1 which is a\nsquare.\n\nRepeating this argument for all such \\emph{i} and noticing that this\nargument is symmetric in \\emph{x} and \\emph{y}, we see that\n\n$\\displaystyle x = \\prod_{p_{i} \\mid x}p_{i}^{2\\alpha_{i}} = \\left(\\prod_{p_{i} \\mid x}p_{i}^{\\alpha_{i}}\\right)^{2} = u^{2}$\n\nand\n\n$\\displaystyle y = \\prod_{p_{i} \\mid y}p_{i}^{2\\alpha_{i}} = \\left(\\prod_{p_{i} \\mid y}p_{i}^{\\alpha_{i}}\\right)^{2} = v^{2}$\n\ncompleting the proof."
