        "We have $4$ slots to fill and $7$ people to fill them. So that means, we\nhave $7$ choices for the first slot, $6$ for the second, $5$ for the\nthird and $4$ for the fourth. Since the number of choices for each slot\ndoes not dependent on the choice of the previous spots we need to\nmultiply these numbers. So the total number of ways to fill the slots is\n$7\\cdot6\\cdot5\\cdot4 = \\frac{7!}{3!} = 840$. There are $840$ ways to\nfill the slots."
