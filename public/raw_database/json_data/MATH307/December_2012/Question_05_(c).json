    "statement": "Consider an internet with six sites. The stochastic matrix describing\nthe behaviour of a web surfer (with damping factor zero) is\n\n\\[P = \\begin{bmatrix}\n0 & 0 & \\frac13 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n\\frac12 & 0 & \\frac13 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & \\frac13 & 0 & 0 & 0 & \\frac12 \\\\\n\\frac12 & \\frac13 & 0 & 0 & \\frac12 & 0 \\\\\n0 & \\frac13 & 0 & 1 & 0 & \\frac12 \\\\\n0 & 0 & \\frac13 & 0 & \\frac12 & 0\n\\end{bmatrix}\\]\n\n\\textbf{(c)} Introduce a damping factor of 1/2 so that the surfer now\nmoves according to the stochastic matrix \\emph{(1/2)P + (1/2)Q} where\n\\emph{Q} is the stochastic matrix describing a surfer picking any site\nat random (including the current site). Beginning equal probabilities of\nbeing at each site, what are the probabilities of being at each site\nafter one step?",
