        "This statement is \\textbf{false}. It reads like the conclusion of\nRolle's Theorem; however, Rolle's Theorem has two conditions: that $f$\nbe continuous on a closed interval (in this case the interval $[0,1]$)\nand differentiable on the same open interval (in this case $(0,1)$). If\nwe drop either of these two conditions, then the conclusion of Rolle's\nTheorem does not necessarily hold.\n\nFor example, suppose $f$ is not differentiable on $(0,1)$. Then we can\ndraw the picture:\n\n\\begin{figure}[htbp]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=.5\\textwidth]{ScienceMathExamResourcesCoursesMath110April2011Question1cv2a.jpg}\n\\caption{ScienceMathExamResourcesCoursesMath110April2011Question1cv2a.jpg}\n\\end{figure}\n\nWhile this graph satisfies $f(0) = f(1) = 1$ there is no point where the\nderivative is zero, because the derivative is either 1, -1, or\nundefined.\n\nSuppose $f$ is not continuous on $[0,1]$. Then you can draw a picture\nlike this:\n\n\\begin{figure}[htbp]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=.5\\textwidth]{ScienceMathExamResourcesCoursesMath110April2011Question1cv2b.jpg}\n\\caption{ScienceMathExamResourcesCoursesMath110April2011Question1cv2b.jpg}\n\\end{figure}\n\nWhere clearly the derivative is never zero, even though\n$f(0) = f(1) = 1$.\n\nEither example (or a similar example) would suffice to prove the\nstatement false."
