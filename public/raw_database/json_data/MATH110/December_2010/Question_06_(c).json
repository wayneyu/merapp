        "If two lines are perpendicular, their slopes are negative reciprocals of\neach other, that is, if one line has slope $a/b$, the other will have\nslope $-b/a$. Therefore, what we're really concerned about here is the\nslope of each line mentioned in the problem statement. We already have\nthe slope of the line from part (b), namely 3/4, so it remains to find\nthe slope of the line through (3, -4) and the origin. This hardly\nrequires any calculus - we just calculate the slope using the two points\n(0,0) and (3, -4).\n\n$\\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} = \\frac{-4 - 0}{3 - 0} = \\frac{-4}{3}$\n\nIn this case, we have slope $-\\frac{4}{3}$ and the line from part (b)\nhas slope $\\frac{3}{4}$. These two numbers are negative reciprocals so\nthe two lines are perpendicular."
