Justify your answer and show your work.\nFull simplification of numerical answers is required unless explicitly\nstated otherwise.}\n\nA bottle of soda pop at room temperature (70$^{\\circ}$F) is placed in a\nrefrigerator where the temperature is 40$^{\\circ}$F. After half an hour\nthe soda pop has cooled to 60$^{\\circ}$F. How long does it take for the\nsoda pop to cool to 50$^{\\circ}$F?",

        "The solution of the differential equation $\\frac{dT}{dt} = k(T-T_s)$\nis\\\\\\\\ $\\displaystyle T - T_s = (T_0 - T_s)e^{kt}$, where $T$ is the\ntemperature of an object, $T_s$ is the temperature of its surroundings,\nand $k$ is some constant.\n\nWe are given that $T_s = 40,\\, T_0 = 70,\\, T(0.5) = 60$, where $t$ is in\nhours. Thus we begin by solving for $k$:\n\n\\begin{align*}\nT(t) - T_s &= (T_0 - T_s)e^{kt}\n\\\\ 60 - 40 &= (70 - 40)e^{k\\cdot0.5}\n\\\\ e^{0.5k} &= \\frac{2}{3}\n\\\\ \\frac{1}{2}k &= \\ln\\frac{2}{3}\n\\\\ k &= \\ln\\frac{4}{9}\n\\\\\n\\\\ \\therefore T(t) &= 30e^{\\ln\\left(\\frac{4}{9}\\right)\\cdot t} + 40\n\\\\ &= 30\\left(\\frac{4}{9}\\right)^t + 40\n\\end{align*}\n\nFinally, solving for $t$ when $\\displaystyle T(t) = 50$ yields:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n50 &= 30\\left(\\frac{4}{9}\\right)^t + 40\n\\\\ \\frac{1}{3} &= \\left(\\frac{4}{9}\\right)^t\n\\\\ \\ln\\frac{1}{3} &= t\\ln\\frac{4}{9}\n\\\\ t &= \\frac{\\ln\\frac{1}{3}}{\\ln\\frac{4}{9}} = {\\color{blue} \\frac{\\ln3}{\\ln\\frac{9}{4}} \\,\\,\\mathrm{hours}}\\end{align*}"
