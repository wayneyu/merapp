        "In order for a function to be continuous on the interval\n$( - \\infty, \\infty )$ it must be defined everywhere. However, in the\nprevious part of the question, we just showed that \\emph{g} is not\ndefined at an infinite number of points. Thus \\emph{g} is not continuous\non $(- \\infty, \\infty)$."
