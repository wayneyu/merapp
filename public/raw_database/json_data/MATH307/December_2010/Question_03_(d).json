        "In\n\\href{Science:Math_Exam_Resources/Courses/MATH307/December_2010/Question_03_(a)}{part\n(a)} we were asked to find the different equations that can be drawn\nfrom the condition that $f(x)$ goes through all the given points. This\nyielded the following 6 equations:\n\n\\begin{align*}\np_{1}(x_{1}) &= y_{1}\\\\\np_{1}(x_{2}) &= y_{2}\\\\\np_{2}(x_{2}) &= y_{2}\\\\\np_{2}(x_{3}) &= y_{3}\\\\\np_{3}(x_{3}) &= y_{3}\\\\\np_{3}(x_{4}) &= y_{4}\\end{align*}\n\nIn\n\\href{Science:Math_Exam_Resources/Courses/MATH307/December_2010/Question_03_(b)}{part\n(b)} we were then asked to find the equations that can be found from the\ncondition that the function, $f(x)$, was also first order\ndifferentiable. This yielded 2 more equations:\n\n\\begin{align*}\np'_{1}(x_{2}) &= p'_{2}(x_{2})\\\\\np'_{2}(x_{3}) &= p'_{3}(x_{3})\\end{align*}\n\nThis same method can be applied in\n\\href{Science:Math_Exam_Resources/Courses/MATH307/December_2010/Question_03_(c)}{part\n(c)} to find the conditions that the function is second order\ndifferentiable yielding 2 more equations:\n\n\\begin{align*}\np''_{1}(x_{2}) &= p''_{2}(x_{2})\\\\\np''_{2}(x_{3}) &= p''_{3}(x_{3})\\end{align*}\n\nTherefore, we were able to find 10 equations in total using the\nconditions set forth in\n\\href{Science:Math_Exam_Resources/Courses/MATH307/December_2010/Question_03_(a)}{(a)},\n\\href{Science:Math_Exam_Resources/Courses/MATH307/December_2010/Question_03_(b)}{(b)},\nand\n\\href{Science:Math_Exam_Resources/Courses/MATH307/December_2010/Question_03_(c)}{(c)}.\nHowever, we have three polynomials and each of these polynomials have 4\nunknowns ($a_{i}$, $b_{i}$, $c_{i}$, and $d_{i}$ ; $i=1,2,3$), so we\nhave a total of 12 unknowns that we need to solve for. It follows that\nwe would need 2 more equations in order to have the same number of\nequations as unknowns.\n\nThese equations are usually prescribed depending on the context of the\nproblem. The usual condition is that the second derivative values at the\nendpoints should be 0. Thus, the last 2 equations that we need are:\n\n\\begin{align*}\np''_{1}(x_{1}) &= 0\\\\\np''_{3}(x_{4}) &= 0\\end{align*}"
