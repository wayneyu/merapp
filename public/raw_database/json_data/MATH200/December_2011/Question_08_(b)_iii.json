        "Region of integration is part of head or body?\n\nIn the integral (3), spherical coordinates are used, where the radius\ncovers the interval $\\displaystyle \\rho\\in[0,2\\sqrt{3}]=[0,\\sqrt{12}]$,\nthe horizontal angle covers $\\displaystyle \\theta\\in[0,2\\pi]$ which is\nthe whole circle and the vertical angle covers\n$\\displaystyle \\phi\\in\\left[\\frac{\\pi}{6},\\pi\\right]$.\n\nHence, the region of integration is a ball with radius\n$\\displaystyle \\sqrt{12}$, where a cone is cut out from above. Since the\nbody of the snowman is a ball with radius $\\displaystyle \\sqrt{12}$,this\nregion must be part of the body .\n\n Finding the equation of the enclosing sphere\n\nSince the region of integration is part of the ball with radius\n$\\displaystyle \\sqrt{12}$, whose centre is in the origin, it is enclosed\nby the sphere\n\n$\\displaystyle x^2+y^2+z^2 = 12$\n\n Finding the equation of the enclosing cone\n\nIt is left to find the equation of the cone which is cut out from the\nregion of integration. The cone is defined through the angle\n$\\displaystyle \\phi$.\n\nTo find the equation of the cone, we must rewrite the expression\n$\\displaystyle \\phi=\\frac16\\pi$ into cartesian coordinates. The\nrelationship between spherical and cartesian coordinates is\n\n\\begin{align*}\nx&=\\rho\\cos(\\theta)\\sin(\\phi)\\\\\ny&=\\rho\\sin(\\theta)\\sin(\\phi)\\\\\nz&=\\rho\\cos(\\phi)\\end{align*}\n\nwhere $\\displaystyle \\rho = \\sqrt{x^2+y^2+z^2}$. Pluging in\n$\\displaystyle \\phi = \\frac16\\pi$ gives for $\\displaystyle z$\n\n\\begin{align*}\n z&=\\rho \\cos\\left(\\frac16\\pi\\right) = \\frac{\\sqrt3}{2}\\rho = \\frac{\\sqrt3}{2}\\sqrt{x^2+y^2+z^2}\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\ z^2 &= \\frac34(x^2+y^2+z^2)\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\ 4z^2 &= 3x^2+3y^2+3z^2\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\ z^2 &= 3x^2+3y^2\\end{align*}\n\nwhich is the required cone equation."

        "Consider the upper and lower limits of the variables of integration.\nAccording to the size and shape of the region of integration, in\nparticular $\\displaystyle \\rho\\in[0,2\\sqrt{3}]  = [0,\\sqrt{12}]$, you\ncan identify it with the head or body of the snowman.", 
        "Once you found that the region of integration (3) is part of the body,\nthe sphere enclosing the region must be the sphere equation of the body.\n\nTo find the cone-equation of the cone, which is cut out from the sphere,\nthe angle $\\displaystyle \\phi = \\frac16\\pi$ is important. Rewrite the\nexpression $\\displaystyle \\phi = \\frac16\\pi$ from spherical coordinates\ninto the equivalent expression in cartesian coordinates."
