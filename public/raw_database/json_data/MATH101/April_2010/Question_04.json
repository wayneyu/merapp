How much total work, in ft$\\cdot$lbs, is done by\nthe ants in building the anthill? For the density of sand, use the value\n$150\\, \\text{lb}/\\text{ft}^3.$",

        "Consider the diagram for building the anthill\n\\includegraphics[width=.5\\textwidth]{MATH101_April_2010_Question_4_Cone.png}. We can think\nof building the hill as stacking several small cylinders of height\n$\\Delta{}x$ or $\\textrm{d}x$ (thinking forward to integration) from the\nground (\\emph{x=1}) to the top (\\emph{x=0}). Consider the anthill at\nsome intermediate distance from the top x (at a distance \\emph{1-x} from\nthe ground). This point is represented in the diagram as $x_i^*$. The\nvolume of a new cylinder to add onto the anthill will be\n\n\\begin{align*}\\displaystyle{}dV=\\pi{}(r(x))^2\\textrm{d}x\\end{align*}\n\nwhere \\emph{dx} is the height of the cylinder and \\emph{r(x)} is the\nradius of the anthill at the current height. There is a similar triangle\nproblem between the top of the completed anthill and the current disk\nwe're looking at \\includegraphics[width=.5\\textwidth]{Math101Apr10Q4-similartri.png} and so\nwe can determine the radius at our current height \\emph{x} via\n\n\\begin{align*}\\frac{1}{1/2} = \\frac{x}{r(x)}\\end{align*}\n\nand so\n\n\\begin{align*}r(x) = \\frac{x}{2}.\\end{align*}\n\nNotice that indeed when we're at the top (\\emph{x=0}) then the radius is\nzero and when we're at the bottom (\\emph{x=1}) that the radius is 1/2.\nWe therefore have that the new amount of sand volume we are adding is\n\n\\begin{align*}dV=\\frac{\\pi}{4}x^2\\textrm{d}x.\\end{align*}\n\nIn the problem we are given a density $150lb/ft^3$ which is actually a\n\\textbf{force} density because lbs is a measure of force. This is\ntelling us the force required to lift sand of a given volume which is\nprecisely what we are trying to do with our cylinder of sand and so the\nforce required to lift it is\n\n\\texttt{~force~=~force~density~}$\\times$\\texttt{~volume~}\n\n\\begin{align*}dF=150dV=\\frac{150\\pi}{4}x^2\\textrm{d}x.\\end{align*}\n\nThe work required to lift this cylinder to its position in the hill at\n\\emph{x} will be this force \\emph{dF} multiplied with the height we have\nto lift it from the ground \\emph{1-x}. Therefore the amount of work to\nlift this cylinder is\n\n\\begin{align*}dW=(1-x)dF=\\frac{150\\pi}{4}x^2(1-x)\\textrm{d}x.\\end{align*}\n\nThis is the work to build one small cylinder. The whole hill is built by\nadding cylinders for all values of \\emph{x} and so to get the total work\nwe integrate\n\n\\begin{align*}\n\\text{work} =\\int_0^1\\textrm{d}W &= \\int_0^1  \\frac{150\\pi}{4} x^2\\,(1-x) dx\\\\\n&= \\left[\\frac{150\\pi x^3}{12} - \\frac{150\\pi x^4}{16}\\right]_0^1 \\\\\n&= \\frac{150 \\pi}{12} -\\frac{150\\pi }{16} \\\\\n&= \\frac{25\\pi}{8}\\end{align*}\n\nLet us do a quick sanity check on the units to see if we have missed out\nanything.\n\nThe volume is in $ft^3$, and the density is given in $lb / ft^3$, so the\nweight is in $lb$, finally work is force (weight) times distance (which\nis in $ft$), so we get our work to be in $ft\\cdot lb$, which is right.\n\nIn conclusion, the work done by the ants to build the anthill is\n$\\frac{25\\pi}{8} ft\\cdot lb$."
