    "statement": "In the 1986 Chernobyl reactor explosion, substantial amounts of the\nisotope strontium-90 (\\textsuperscript{90}Sr) contaminated the area\naround the nuclear plant. \\textsuperscript{90}Sr undergoes exponential\nradioactive decay with a half-life of 29 years. Write down a\n``calculator-ready`` expression for the percentage of the origina\n\\textsuperscript{90}Sr remaining today (use the year the exam was\nwritten).",

        "We know that the amount of \\textsuperscript{90}Sr remaining at a time\n$t$ is modeled by the equation $S(t) = S_0e^{kt}$, where $S_0$ is the\ninitial quantity and \\emph{k} is a rate of decay. Our first task is to\nfind \\emph{k}. Using the information that the half-life of\n\\textsuperscript{90}Sr is 29 years, we know that when \\emph{t} = 29,\n\\emph{S}(29) = \\emph{S}\\textsubscript{0}/2. Plugging this into our\nequation of exponential decay, we get:\n\n\\begin{align*}\nS_0 e^{k\\cdot29} &= \\frac{S_0}2  \\\\\ne^{k\\cdot29} &= \\frac12 \\\\\nk\\cdot29  &= \\ln\\left(\\frac12\\right) \\\\\nk &= \\frac{\\ln\\left(\\frac12\\right)}{29}\n\\end{align*}\n\nNote that \\emph{k} \\textless{} 0 as expected: the amount of\n\\textsuperscript{90}Sr declines over time. Putting \\emph{k} back into\nthe formula $S(t) = S_0e^{kt}$, we get\n\n\\[\\displaystyle\nS(t) = S_0e^{(\\ln(1/2)/29) t}\\]\n\nYou can leave this expression as is, or simplify it to get\n\n\\[\\displaystyle\nS(t) = S_0\\left(1/2\\right)^{t/29}\\]\n\nTo find the percentage of \\textsuperscript{90}Sr remaining today, we\nsimply plug in the amount of time that has elapsed since the initial\nexplosion in 1986; in 2011, that is 25 years. So\n\n\\[\\displaystyle\nS(25) = S_0(1/2)^{25/29}\\]\n\nThe percentage of $S_0$ remaining is thus\n\n\\[\\frac{S(25)}{S(0)} = \\frac{S_0(1/2)^{25/29}}{S_0} = (1/2)^{25/29}\\]"
