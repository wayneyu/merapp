        "\\textbf{False:} To hunt for discontinuities, we have to check inside\neach piece and also at the boundary.\n\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\itemsep1pt\\parskip0pt\\parsep0pt\n\\item\n  For the boundary to be continuous, we must have:\n\n  \\begin{align*}\n  \\lim_{x\\rightarrow 1^-} f(x) &=\\lim_{x\\rightarrow 1^+} f(x)\\\\\n  \\lim_{x\\rightarrow 1^-} \\frac{3}{x+2} &=\\lim_{x\\rightarrow 1^+} \\sqrt{x}\\\\\n  \\frac{3}{1+2} &=\\sqrt{1} \\\\\n  1&=1.\\end{align*}\n\n  So the limits exists and is equal to $1$ which happens to be\n  $f(1) =1$. So the function in continuous at the boundary.\n\\item\n  On the right of $x=1$, the function is continuous since $\\sqrt{x}$ is\n  only undefined for $x<0$ which is not covered by this case.\n\\item\n  On the left of $x=1$, the function is discontinuous at $x=-2$ since\n  the denominator is $0$. This fall inside the region considered. So\n  $f(x)$ is discontinuous at $x=-2$.\n\\end{itemize}\n\nThat means $f(x)$ is NOT continuous over all real numbers."
