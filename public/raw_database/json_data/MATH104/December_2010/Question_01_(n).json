(Approximating at \\emph{x = 1} is a logical choice, as 1 is\nclose to 0.8, and we know that $\\ln(1) = 0$.)\n\nWe know $\\frac{d}{dx}\\ln(x)=\\frac1x$, which is equal to 1 when $x=1$.\nSubstituting this into the linear approximation formula, we get,\n\n\\[\\ln(0.8)\\approx \\ln(1)+1(0.8-1) = 0-0.2=-0.2\\]"
