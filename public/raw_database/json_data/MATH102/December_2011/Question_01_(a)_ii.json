        "This is a quotient of functions and so let $\\displaystyle f(x) = x$ and\n$\\displaystyle g(x) = \\ln(\\tfrac{1}{x})$. Then, by the quotient rule, we\nhave\n\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{d}{dx} \\frac{x}{\\ln(\\tfrac{1}{x})} = \\frac{f'(x)g(x) - f(x)g'(x)}{g(x)^{2}}\\end{align*}\n\nNow, $\\displaystyle f'(x) = 1$ and for $\\displaystyle g'(x)$, we use the\nchain rule to see that\n\n$\\displaystyle g'(x) = \\frac{1}{\\tfrac{1}{x}}(-x^{-2}) = -\\frac{1}{x}$\n\nNote, we could also have noticed that\n\n$\\displaystyle g(x) = \\ln(\\tfrac{1}{x}) = -\\ln(x)$ and hence\n$\\displaystyle g'(x) = -\\frac{1}{x}$.\n\nThus, combining all this information, we have\n\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{d}{dx} \\frac{x}{\\ln(\\tfrac{1}{x})} &= \\frac{(1)(\\ln(\\tfrac{1}{x})) - x\\bigg(\\frac{-1}{x}\\bigg)}{(\\ln(\\tfrac{1}{x}))^{2}} \\\\ \n&= \\frac{\\ln(\\tfrac{1}{x}) + 1}{(\\ln(\\tfrac{1}{x}))^{2}} \\\\\n&= \\frac{-\\ln(x) + 1}{(-\\ln(x))^{2}} \\\\\n&= \\frac{1-\\ln(x)}{(\\ln(x))^{2}}\\end{align*}\n\nand any of the last three answers would be accepted."
