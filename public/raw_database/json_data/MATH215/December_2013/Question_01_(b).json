        "We first need to find the homogeneous solution. The characteristic\npolynomial $r^2 - 4r + 5$ has roots\n$r^\\pm = \\frac{4 \\pm \\sqrt{16-20}}{2} = 2 \\pm i$ and hence the\nhomogeneous solution is a linear combination of $e^{2x} \\sin x$ and\n$e^{2x} \\cos x$.\n\nNo such terms appear in the forcing function. The forcing function\n$x \\sin x$ is a degree one polynomial times a sinusoidal function. We\nthus would guess a particular solution of form\n$x_p = (Ax + B) \\sin x + (Cx + D) \\cos x$."
