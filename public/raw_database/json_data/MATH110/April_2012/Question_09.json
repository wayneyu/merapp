        "Because $e^{x}$ is its own derivative, our anti-derivative for the\nfunction $e^{3-x}$ will probably be very similar to the original\nfunction. In fact, $F(x) = - e^{3-x}$ will work; you can check by\ndifferentiating using the chain rule to get\n\n\\[\\displaystyle\nF'(x) = -(-e^{3-x}) = e^{3-x} = f(x)\\]\n\nThis is one anti-derivative. To find another one, we can simply add a\nconstant to the anti-derivative shown above, say\n$F_2(x) = -e^{3-x} + 5$. When we differentiate, the constant will\ndisappear, giving us the same derivative as before."
