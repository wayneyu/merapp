        "We are told that the function $g \\circ f$\u00c2~is surjective and we want to\nshow that the function $g$ is surjective as well. For this, let us\nconsider an element in the image of $g$, that is an element \\emph{a} in\nthe set \\emph{A} (since $g$ sends elements from \\emph{B} to elements in\n\\emph{A}).\n\nTo show the surjectivity we need to show that there is at least one\nelement \\emph{b} in the set \\emph{B} which is mapped to \\emph{a} by the\nfunction \\emph{g}. Now the function $g \\circ f$ sends elements of the\nset \\emph{A} to the set \\emph{A} and is surjective. So there must exist\nan element''a''' in the set \\emph{A} such that\n\n\\begin{align*}(g \\circ f)(a')=a\\end{align*} But since\n\n\\begin{align*}(g \\circ f)(a')=g(f(a'))\\end{align*} we can say that the element \\emph{f(a')},\nwhich is an element of the set \\emph{B} is the element \\emph{b} that we\nare looking for since it is mapped by \\emph{g} to the element \\emph{a}\nas requested. This explains why \\emph{g} is surjective."
