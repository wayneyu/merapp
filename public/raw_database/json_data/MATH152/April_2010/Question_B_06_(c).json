        "First pick a known vector on \\emph{P}. A convenient choice will be\n\\emph{(0, 1, 2)} (other vertices will work too).\n\nLet \\emph{(x, y, z)} be an arbitrary vector on \\emph{P} (this represents\nall possible vectors on \\emph{P}, drawn with tail at origin and head on\n\\emph{P}), then the difference \\emph{(x, y, z) - (0, 1, 2)} gives a\nvector lying in \\emph{P}.\n\nThis vector must then be perpendicular to the normal vector, which gives\nthe equation:\n\n\\begin{align*}[(x, y, z) - (0, 1, 2)] \\cdot (-3, -3, 1) = 0\\end{align*}\n\nSo\n\n\\begin{align*}-3x - 3y + z = (0, 1, 2) \\cdot (-3, -3, 1) = -1\\end{align*}\n\nDividing both sides by $-3$ gives\n$b = 1, c = -\\frac{1}{3}, d = \\frac{1}{3}$"

        "There are three unknowns and we know 3 vectors on \\emph{P}, so plugging\nthem in will give a 3 by 3 linear system that can be solved by Gaussian\nelimination.\n\nHowever, this is not an efficient method. We know from part (b) that\nvectors lying in the plane \\emph{P} (meaning we can draw the heads and\ntails both in \\emph{P}) should all be perpendicular to the normal\nvector. Use this information to define an equation using dot product."
