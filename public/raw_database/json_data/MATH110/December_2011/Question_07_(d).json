        "This question is asking which lines through $P$ are also tangent lines\nto the curve. In order for a line through P to be a tangent line, it\nmust pass through a point on the curve. We found the slope of such a\nline in part (b). Furthermore, the slope between that point and P must\nbe equal to the value of the derivative at that point. which is what we\nfound in part (c).\n\nWe know that the slope of a line between \\emph{P (4, -12)} and a point\n(\\emph{a}, \\emph{a}\\textsuperscript{2} - 6\\emph{a}) on the curve is:\n\n\\[-\\frac{a^2-6a+12}{4-a}\\]\n\nThe slope of the tangent line at the same point on the curve, (\\emph{a},\n\\emph{a}\\textsuperscript{2} - 6\\emph{a}) is:\n\n\\[\\displaystyle\n2a - 6\\]\n\nWe set these two slopes equal to each other and solve for \\emph{a}.\n\n\\begin{align*}\n-\\frac{a^2-6a+12}{4-a} &= 2a - 6 \\\\\n-(a^2-6a+12) &= (2a - 6)(4-a) \\\\\n-a^2+6a-12) &= -2a^2+ 14a -24 \\\\\na^2-8a+12) &= 0 \\\\\n(a - 6) (a - 2) &= 0 \\end{align*}\n\nSo \\emph{a = 2} and \\emph{a = 6}. Plugging these back into our original\nslopes (either one will work, since we have found the values where the\ntwo are equal) we get the two slopes of 6 and -2."
