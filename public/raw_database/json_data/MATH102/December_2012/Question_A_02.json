My original sketch to solve the problem looked like the\nthumbnail on the right.\n\\includegraphics[width=.5\\textwidth]{MER_Math_102_December_2012_Question_A2_Solution_sketch.jpg}.\nThe point of drawing a sketch is often just to understand what the\nproblem is asking.)\n\nNow there are two ways to compute the slope of the tangent line above.\nThe first is our traditional slope formula:\n\n$m = \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} = \\frac{\\cos(a) - 0}{a - 0} = \\frac{\\cos(a)}{a}$\n\nThe second is through the derivative, as this is the tangent line of\n$y = \\cos x$ at \\emph{x = a}:\n\n$\\displaystyle y' = -\\sin x$\n\n$\\displaystyle m = - \\sin (a)$\n\nAs these two methods are giving the slope of the same line, they must be\nequal:\n\n$\\frac{\\cos(a)}{a} = -\\sin(a)$\n\nCross-multiplying gives:\n\n$\\frac{\\cos(a)}{\\sin(a)} = -a$\n\nOr $\\cot (a) = -a$, which is answer \\textbf{(b)}."
