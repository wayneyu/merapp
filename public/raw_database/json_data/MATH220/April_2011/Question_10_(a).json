        "By definition of the supremum of a set, sup(\\emph{B}) is the smallest\nreal number that is larger or equal to all the numbers in the set\n\\emph{B}. Since all the numbers of the set \\emph{B} are also numbers of\nthe set \\emph{A}, we can conclude that sup(\\emph{A}) is also larger or\nequal to all the numbers of the set \\emph{B} (since it is larger or\nequal to all numbers in the set \\emph{A}) but since sup(\\emph{B}) is the\nsmallest real number with that property we can conclude that\n\n\\begin{align*}\\sup(B) \\leq \\sup(A)\\end{align*}\n\nNow inf(\\emph{A}) is a number that is less or equal than any number in\nthe set \\emph{A} and so since \\emph{B} is a subset, it is in particular\nless or equal to any number in the set \\emph{B}. Since sup(\\emph{B}) is\nlarger than any number in the set \\emph{B} we can conclude that\n\n\\begin{align*}\\inf(A) \\leq \\sup(B)\\end{align*}\n\n\\textbf{\\emph{Note:}} \\emph{we could actually prove the more interesting\nand stronger statement:}\n\n\\begin{align*}\\inf(A) \\leq \\inf(B) \\leq \\sup(B) \\leq \\sup(A).\\end{align*}"
