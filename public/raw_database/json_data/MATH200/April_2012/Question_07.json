        "Since \\emph{D} is the unit disc, we know that it is a circle of radius 1\nand so it has area \\emph{$\\pi$}, i.e.\n\n\\[\\displaystyle A(D) = \\pi\\] The centre of \\emph{D} is the origin and so\n\\emph{(a,b) = (0,0)}. To evaluate the integral,\n\n\\[\\iint_{D} \\sqrt{(x - 0)^{2} + (y - 0)^{2}}\\,dx\\,dy = \\iint_{D} \\sqrt{x^{2} + y^{2}}\\,dx\\,dy\\]\nwe use polar coordinates:\n\n\\[\\iint_{D} \\sqrt{x^{2} + y^{2}}\\,dx\\,dy = \\int_{0}^{2\\pi}\\int_{0}^{1} r^{2}\\,dr\\,d\\theta\\]\nwhere we have used the fact that $dx\\,dy = r\\,dr\\,d\\theta$ (i.e. the\nJacobian of the transformation from Cartesian to Polar coordinates) and\n$\\sqrt{x^{2} + y^{2}} = r$. Evaluating the integral gives:\n\n\\[\\int_{0}^{2\\pi}\\int_{0}^{1} r^{2}\\,dr\\,d\\theta = 2\\pi \\int_{0}^{1}r^{2}\\,dr = \\frac{2\\pi}{3}.\\]\nHence, the average distance from any point within \\emph{D} and the\ncentre of \\emph{D} (the origin) is ${\\color{blue}\n\\frac{1}{A(D)}\\iint_{D} \\sqrt{x^{2} + y^{2}}\\,dx\\,dy = \\frac{2}{3}.}$"

        "Without doing any calculations, where is the centre of the unit disc,\n$\\{(x,y)\\,|\\,x^{2} + y^{2} \\le 1\\}$? What is the discs' area?", 
        "Try making a change of coordinates to simplify the evaluation of the\nintegrals that will show up. Don't forget the Jacobian."
