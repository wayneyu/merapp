        "The trick here is to recognize the series given as a geometric series.\n\nThe question provides the formula\n$1 + r + r^2 + ... = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} r^k = \\frac{1}{1-r}$ for\n$|r| < 1.$\n\nEssentially, would like to evaluate the series by finding a suitable r\nso that this formula can be applied.\n\nLet's first re-express\n$\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} (-1)^k 2^{k+1} x^k =\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} 2 (-1)^k 2^k x^k$\nas $2 \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} (-1)^k 2^{k} x^k$ so that all terms in the\nsummation have an exponent of k and the indexing starts at 0.\n\nNow we note that\n$2 \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} (-1)^k 2^{k} x^k = 2 \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} [(-1)(2)(x)]^k = 2 \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} (-2x)^k$.\n\nThe formula provided now works with $r = -2x$. The series sums to\n$2 \\times \\frac{1}{1 - (-2x)} = \\frac{2}{1 + 2x}.$"
