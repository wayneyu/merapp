        "A set \\emph{C} is countable if it has the same cardinality as the set\n$\\mathbb{N}$ of natural numbers. In other words, there exists a\nbijective function $f: C \\rightarrow \\mathbb{N}.$ (Equivalently, there\nexists a bijective function $g: \\mathbb{N} \\rightarrow C.$)"

        "An example is \\textbf{not} a definition. But it sure helps to have some\nexamples and counter-examples to understand what you are trying to\ndefine."
