        "Let $u=x$ and $dv = \\cos x dx$. This gives $du = dx$ and $v = \\sin x$.\nHence, using integration by parts, we have\n\n\\begin{align*}\n\\int_{0}^{1}x\\cos x \\, dx &= x\\sin x \\mid_{0}^{1} - \\int_{0}^{1}\\sin x \\, dx \\\\\n&= (1)\\sin(1) - (0)\\sin(0) - (-\\cos(x))|_{0}^{1} \\\\\n&= \\sin(1) - (-\\cos(1) + \\cos(0)) \\\\\n&= \\sin(1) + \\cos(1) - 1 \\end{align*}\n\ncompleting the problem."
